Career Power

Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work.

A.
What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires, an agent of change, a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better, as the early theorists believed. It's not simply about intelligence, either. Pat Dixon, author of the book Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace, says that leadership is about 'making things happen through people who are as enhuastic and interested as you are'.
Enthusiasm is a key element and, to convey it and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak out articulately and with conviction. 'It's having the confidence to say "I believe" instead of "I think", maintains Dixon.

John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, says, 'Most people have a far greater potential for leadership than they realise. The process of becoming a leader is recognising those latent talents, developing them and using them.'
In one sense, we are all born leaders - we just need the right circumstances in which to flourish. While it's quite easy to recognise leadership in the grand sense -- be it in the form of figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Ghandi or even Richard Branson - it may be more difficult to relate it to our own workplace. And yet this quality is now regarded as the cornerstone of effective management.
 

C.
Consider the best and worst boss you've ever had. They may have been equally good at setting objectives, meeting deadlines and budgets. But what about how they achieved them? The best leader will have motivated you and may have given you support. The worst leader would have made you feel like a small cog in the corporate machinery and kept information from you, and then when things went wrong would have reacted as if it were your fault. The first led (very well); the second simply managed (very badly).

Leaders and managers can be seen as different animals. Managers tend to enjoy working according to set boundaries. Leaders create their own horizons. 'A good manager can keep even an inefficient company running relatively smoothly,' writes Micheal Shea, the author of Leadership Rules. 'But a good leader can transform a demoralised organisation - whether it's a company, a football team or a nation.' 

E.
Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can benefit from improving your leadership skills. There are definite lessons to be learnt: 
* Leadership is something we do best when we choose to do it. So find out where your passions and convictions lie. Next time you feel inspired to lead, harness the energy it gives you and act on it.
* Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is a powerful part of you. Recognise it.
* Collaboration can be fine, but there will be times when firm leadership is required. Experiment with your style. If you are a natural transactor, try being the negotiator. If you always ask for the views of others, try taking the lead. Watch how the outcome is changed by this change in you.
* You have to set goals, then beat them. Look at the demands of your job and define those where being a leader will greatly enhance your effectiveness and career prospects.

F. 
* Leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes. Learn how to delegate and motivate; organise and chastise; praise and raise.
* Don't assume that your way of leading will immediately win over colleagues. It may even alienate them. Keep working on your communication skills. You don't have to be liked - but your ideas and accomplishments do.
* Be visible and accessible to those who are important. But bear in mind * You don't have to lead all the time. Be clear on where your contribution is vital and how you can help others to develop as leaders.
