Mission to Mars 

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. 
This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel, for fuel efficiency is a priority - the 2018 deadline has been fixed since the next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn't until 2031. It's a normal order, but the race is on to develop systems involving totally new technologies. Given that these can be put in place soon enough, the spacecraft might just make it. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to achieve these ambitious goals will not be in vain, as they will lead to valuable advances for future missions.
