England's breakfast revolution 

The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts, but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. Admittedly, there are scattered references to travellers having a meal at dawn before embarking on arduous journeys, and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without unless they were monarchs or nobles. 
However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast, as individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours. Often this involved starting work extremely early. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.
