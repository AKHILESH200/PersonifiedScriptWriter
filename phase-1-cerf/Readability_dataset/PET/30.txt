HONEY 

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. In fact, there are more than three hundred varieties of honey. 
The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. 
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very
rare. Honey was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. 
Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Research suggests that it prevents tiredness and improves athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be taken for sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care 26 A involves products.
