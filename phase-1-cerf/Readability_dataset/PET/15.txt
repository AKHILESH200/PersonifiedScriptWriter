NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH AN OPEN UNIVERSITY DEGREE 

Like any other university, the Open University can give you a degree. 
However, you don't have to stop working to study. It can also open up a whole variety of interests. 
If you have never studied before, you will enjoy the special, new pleasure of increasing your knowledge. You will make friends of all kinds. You may also find that your qualification provides new career opportunities. 
You don't actually go to the Open University for lectures, but study at home, using television, radio and computer software. You can attend one class a month if you wish at an Open University centre. Of course, there are exams to take, as in any university.
