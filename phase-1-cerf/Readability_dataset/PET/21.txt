MONEY 

What is money? The pound, the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book, a huge bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is only a printed piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, Mr Green the farmer exchanged the com he had grown for Mr Hive's honey. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. The different currencies began to join together, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.
