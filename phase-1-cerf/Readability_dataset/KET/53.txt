The history of horse racing 

From the first history books ever written, it is clear that horse racing has
always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4,500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. 
Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. At first, races were long and between just two horses, but at the beginning of the 18th century this changed. Races became much shorter and had several horses running against each other. 
Today, horse racing is watched by more people than any other sport in the USA, except baseball. It is also very popular in other parts of the world.
