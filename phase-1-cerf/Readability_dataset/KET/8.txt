The Rhino

There are five different types of rhino in the world today. The Black and White Rhino live in the open fields of Africa. The others live in forests in Asia.
All rhinos have big, heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short legs. Each foot has three toes. They usually walk very slowly, but they can run at 50 kilometres an hour. Rhinos are usually quiet and calm animals, and they only eat grass and other plants.
A baby rhino weighs 40 kilos when it is born. It has been inside its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and may live to be 50 years old.
