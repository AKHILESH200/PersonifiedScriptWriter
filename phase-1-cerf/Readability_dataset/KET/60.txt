Dear Keira,
Thank you for your letter. I had my first day at my new school today. A girl called Nicole looked after me and showed me where the classrooms were. She is very nice and I am going to visit her this weekend.
My favourite lesson today was Maths and I was happy because I knew more than the other girls. I also played hockey for the first time. I really enjoyed it. 
Most of the teachers seem friendly but I'm afraid of the head teacher. No one likes him because he shouts a lot. 
I must go now because I have to do my homework.
