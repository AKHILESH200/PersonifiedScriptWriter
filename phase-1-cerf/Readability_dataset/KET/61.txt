Gail Rollins 

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh's best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. 
Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch her up. 
Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays. 'I am with her all the time,' says Mike. 'Sometimes I say, "Are you sure you should be eating that?" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.'
