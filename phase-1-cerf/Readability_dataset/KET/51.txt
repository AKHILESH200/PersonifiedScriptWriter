Hi Anna,
I'm not having a very good week!
Yesterday my team had a volleyball match, but we lost. The other team played much better than we did! Then my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, telephoned with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he's got a summer job. We can't go camping together now. And this morning, my sister got up late so she rode my bike to school! She didn't tell me she needed to use it. I'm really angry with her. 
I hope you have some good news! Write back today if you can.
Greg
