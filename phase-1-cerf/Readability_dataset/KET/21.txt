Dear Jacqueline, 
Would you like to come to the cinema with me after school today? We can go to see Pocahontas at the ABC cinema. The film starts at 6 o'clock. Shall we meet outside the cinema? 
Love, 
Isabella

Dear Isabella,
I am very sorry but I can't go to the cinema this evening. My mother has some work, and I am going to cook dinner. Why don't you invite Karen to go? I hope you like the film. You can tell me about it tomorrow.
Love,
Jacqueline
