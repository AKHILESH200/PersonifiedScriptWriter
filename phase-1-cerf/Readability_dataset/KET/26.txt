Line dancing 

Thousands of people in Britain have a new hobby -- line dancing. In almost every town, you will find clubs and classes for this new activity. 
'Line dancing is easy to learn. If you have two feet and can walk, then you can do it!' Fiona Lever, a teacher, says. 'You don't need a partner because you dance in groups. It's the best way to make new friends. In my classes, there are young and old people. The boys like it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet during the dances!' 
When did line dancing begin? Most people think it started about fifteen years ago when American country music became famous in Britain.
