POSTCARDS 

Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains or castles on them and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. 
Somebody sent the first postcard at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.
