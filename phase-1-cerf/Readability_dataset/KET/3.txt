28 Long Road Brighton 

22nd March 

Dear Pat,

I arrived here three weeks ago. I 'm studying at a language school in Brighton. The students come from many different countries and I have made a lot of new friends. 
There are classes for five hours every day. I like our teacher very much. His name is John and he helps me if I make a mistake. 
 
I want to visit London next weekend because I am going back to my country on Monday. Can I see you there? Please write to me soon.
 
With best wishes from Maria
