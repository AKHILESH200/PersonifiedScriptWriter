Visit the Edinburgh Festival!

Every year, thousands of people come to Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, to be part of the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks every August and September the city is filled with actors and artists from all over the world. They come to Edinburgh for the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time the streets of the city are alive with music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even see artists painting pictures on the streets. One of the best parts of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students do comedy shows in small halls and cafes.
Tens of thousands of tourists come to the Festival to see new films and plays and hear music played by famous musicians. This year, you can see over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries.
The tickets for these performances are quite cheap and it is usually easier to see your favourite star in Edinburgh than it is in London. So come to Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be difficult to find a room, so why not book your hotel now!
