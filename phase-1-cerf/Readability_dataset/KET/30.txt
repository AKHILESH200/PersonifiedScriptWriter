TO ALL STUDENTS:

Would you like to come on a camping trip this weekend?
We are going to go to the forest in the school bus and we will stay at a camp-site from Friday to Sunday. It has hot showers and a small shop and you can rent bicycles there.
The trip costs PS25. It is very cold there at night, so you should take warm clothes and you will need to wear strong shoes. 
If you want yo come, tell me today.
Ahmed,
Student Secretary
