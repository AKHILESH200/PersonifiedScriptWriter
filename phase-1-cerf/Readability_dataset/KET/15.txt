Dear Sir, 
I read your advertisement for English courses in the newspaper. I would like to have some more information. How much does a course cost? Also, how long is each course and when does the next course start?
Yours, 
Maria Gonzalez 
 

Dear Ms. Gonzalez, 
Thank you for your letter. Our next course starts in three weeks, on Monday, 9 May. This is a 6-week course and it costs PS150. If you prefer to begin in June, we have another 10-week course for PS200. I hope that is the information you want. 
Yours, 
David May
