Dear David,
I am going to visit your country next month. I'm going to travel with two friends. We don't know where to stay. Are there any cheap hotels in your town? We would like to stay somewhere in the centre. Can you help us?
Carlos

Dear Carlos,
Hotels in the centre are expensive, but I have good news. I have spoken to my aunt Gloria about you and she says you can all stay at her house. It has more bedrooms that my house! That will be alright with you, won't it?
David
