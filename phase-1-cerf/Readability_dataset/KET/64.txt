Mount Kilimanjaro 

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. 
There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. 
Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so suddenly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes!
