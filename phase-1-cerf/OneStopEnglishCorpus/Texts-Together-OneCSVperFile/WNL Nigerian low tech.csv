However, to successfully solve the variety of challenges, we need variety in our solutionsas well. Sustainability is not just about bringing down emissions, it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves. These initiatives might be low-tech in innovation, but they are high-impact when it comes to creating sustainable change for entire communities.","Solutions to combat climate change are often perceived as hi-tech innovations focused on cutting emissions, creating infrastructure or ef ciency.
