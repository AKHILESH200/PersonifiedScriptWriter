"In the West, people do not usually eat
insects. But in some parts of the world,
insects are an important food and in spring
2013 there will be an effort to show people
that eating insects is not disgusting. And we
may soon be able to buy insects
in supermarkets.","Insects are not usually seen as food except
in a few regions of the world – but now they

supermarket shelves.","Crunchy, full of protein and to be found

been overlooked as food in all but a handful

the yuck factor and putting insects not just on
experimental gastronomic menus but also on
supermarket shelves."
"In April, there will be a festival in London,

three years. Its chef, René Redzepi, says
that ants taste like lemon, and a mixture of
grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like
a strong fish sauce. Bee larvae make a
sweet mayonnaise used instead of eggs and
scientists find new ways to use insects all
the time.","Noma has been named the world’s best

"The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) gives money to projects that show
people they can eat and farm insects in
south-east Asia and Africa. In these places
about two billion people already eat insects
and larvae as a normal part of their diet.

edible species of insect and plans a major
international conference on “this valuable
food source” in 2013.","The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization

"There are lots of insects – there are 40
tonnes of insects for every person in the
world – so they will not become endangered.

"The cost of meat is increasing – it costs
more money now, but also people have
to destroy a lot of rainforest to make
fields or to grow food for cows. Cows also
make methane. The farming of cows, pigs
and sheep makes very big amounts of
greenhouse gases – 35% of the planet’s
methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of
the carbon dioxide.","The cost of meat is rising, not just in terms

"Edible insects make fewer gases, contain
high-quality protein, vitamins and amino
acids, and only need a quarter of the
food that sheep need to make the same
amount of protein. You can grow them on
organic waste. China is already building
huge maggot farms. Zimbabwe is growing
caterpillars and Laos is developing an
insect-harvesting project. One study says
that eating crickets and locusts, and not
eating pork and beef, could help to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95%.","Edible insects produce fewer gases, contain
