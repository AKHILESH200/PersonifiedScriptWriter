"Life isn’t fair sometimes. Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth $48 billion. James Goodfellow also invented something that millions of people around the world use every day – the cash machine – but it didn’t make him rich. In fact, he earned just £10 from the patent and has not made any money from it since.","Sometimes life isn’t fair. Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth an estimated $48bn.

"Who is the inventor of the ATM? People have argued for years over this question. In 2005,a man called John Shepherd-Barron receiveda UK honour as the “inventor of the automatic cash dispenser”. But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM.","“You can imagine how I feel when I see bankers getting £1m bonuses. What have they contributed to the banking industry, compared to me, to merit a £1m bonus,” Goodfellow says. He invented something that generated billions of pounds and he got nothing.","“You can imagine how I feel when I see bankers getting £1m bonuses. I wonder what they contributed to the banking industry more than I did to merit a £1m bonus. It doesn’t make much sense to me but that’s the way of the world,” Goodfellow says."
"In the mid-1960s, Goodfellow’s managers asked him to think of a way to allow customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays. “Most people worked during the week and couldn’t go to the bank. They wanted a solution. The solution was a machine which would give cash to a customer,” he says. “I wanted to develop a cash machine and, to make this happen, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and acoded token.""","There have been arguments for years overwho is “the inventor of the ATM” and, in 2005,a man called John Shepherd-Barron receiveda UK honour as the “inventor of the automatic cash dispenser”. But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM – so it seems that, after all the arguments, he now has his place in history.","It also annoys him that he’s not seen as a good role model for inventors and engineers. Hecame up with a groundbreaking invention that generated billions of pounds “and I got nothing, so who’s going to want to follow in James Goodfellow’s footsteps and get £10 if they have a fantastic success?”"
"Goodfellow’s  first machines were installed in 1967. At around the same time, Shepherd-Barron was developing a similar machine. His machine didn’t use plastic cards – it used cheques.","Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and was asked to devise a way to allow customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays. “Most people worked during the week and couldn’t get to the bank. They wanted a solution. The solution was a machine which would give cash to a recognized customer,” he remembers. “I wanted to developa cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and a coded token.”","There have been arguments for years overwho should of cially go down in history as“the inventor of the ATM” and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour for services to banking as the “inventorof the automatic cash dispenser”. But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM – so it would seem that, after all the squabbling, his place in history isnow assured."
"Most people agree that Shepherd-Barron’s ATM was the “world’s  rst” to be installed and used by the public. The  rst one was at a bank in north London. It was opened on 27 June, 1967 – a month before Goodfellow’s ATM appeared. But, Goodfellow registered the patent for his machine on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before Shepherd-Barron’s ATM machine was  rst used.","This token was a plastic card with holes in it.The patent documents described a system with a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank. After Goodfellow produced a model that showed how the machine would work, prototypes were built and the  rst machines were installed in 1967. At around the sametime, Shepherd-Barron was developing a rival machine. His machine didn’t use plasticcards – instead, it used cheques containing carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance. The machine detected the carbon-14, matched the cheque against a PIN and paid out the cash.","Back in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays. “Most people working during the week couldn’t get to the bank. They wanted a solution. The solution was a machine which would issue cash on demand to a recognized customer,” he recalls. “I setout to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identi cation number] and an associated coded token.”"
"Shepherd-Barron received an of cial honourfor his invention and Goodfellow says: “My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John Shepherd-Barron received the honour in 2005. The Queen gave him this honour for inventing the automatic cash dispenser. That really annoyed me and I complained about it.”","It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the “world’s  rst” to be installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967– a month before Goodfellow’s ATM appeared. However, the patent for Goodfellow’s machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before Shepherd-Barron’s ATM machine was first used.","This token took the form of a plasticcard with holes punched in it. The patent documents proposed a system incorporating a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank and stated: “When the customer wishes to withdraw a pack of banknotes from the system, he simply inserts his punched card in the card reader of the system and operates the set of ten push-buttons in accordance with his personal identification number.”"
"Shepherd-Barron is dead now but, in a 2005 interview, he criticized Goodfellow. He said Goodfellow’s invention was a failure.","Shepherd-Barron received an of cial honour for his achievement and Goodfellow says: “My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John Shepherd-Barron received the OBE in 2005 for inventing the automatic cash dispenser. That really stuck in my throat and I kicked upa fuss.”","Aside from the cards with punched holes,that pretty much describes today’s ATM. After Goodfellow successfully demonstrated the methodology by producing a model, prototypes were built and the  rst machines were installed in 1967."
"The cash machine is now used all over the world and, every year, there are more and more: there are now three million ATMs worldwideand there will be four million by 2020. Thegood news for Goodfellow is that people are beginning to recognize him for his invention. The website ATMInventor.com says: “Who invented the idea of an ATM? We believe it was Luther George Simjian. Who invented the ATM as we know it? It was James Goodfellow for holding a patent date of 1966.”","Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive but, in a 2005 interview, he was quite critical of his rival: “I don’t know him but it’s clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and thatwas important to the banks who bought it. His invention reminds me of the hovercraft, an elegant failure.""","At around the same time, Shepherd-Barron was developing a rival cash-dispensing device. His machine didn’t use plastic cards – instead, it used cheques impregnated with carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance. The machine detected the carbon-14, matched the cheque against a PIN and paid out the cash."
"Even better for Goodfellow, his invention is in a 180-page guidebook called Life in the United Kingdom. In the section about “great British inventions of the twentieth century”, it says: “In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the automatic teller machine (ATM)or ‘cashpoint’.”","The cash machine is now used all over the world and nothing – the contactless revolution, bitcoin, wearable technology, etc – is slowing its growth: there are now 3m ATMs worldwide and, by 2020, there will probably be 4m.","It is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the “world’s  rst” when it comes to being installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967 – a month before Goodfellow’s ATM made its public debut. However, the patent for Goodfellow’s machine was lodged on 2May, 1966, 14 months before the London ATM machine came into service."
"So after all these years, Goodfellow is  nally among a group of famous British inventors with John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing(the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web). When he was asked what he did with the £10 he received in the 1960s, Goodfellow said he spent it on a night out. “It didn’t change my life,” he said.",The good news for Goodfellow is that he is beginning to be recognized for his invention.

We think it was John D White in the US.”,The rivalry between the two men bubbled up when Shepherd-Barron received an of cial honour for his achievement. Goodfellow says: “My one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John Shepherd-Barron received the OBE in 2005. This honour was granted on the basis that he was the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser. That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a bit of a fuss.”

,,"Goodfellow accepts he didn’t invent the concept of a cash-issuing machine “but I did invent a way of doing it. When people talk about the Wright brothers, they didn’t invent the concept of  ying – everyone was trying to do it – but they did it and got the credit for inventing the aeroplane so I think I should get the credit for inventing the cash dispenser.”"
