"Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands is a traditional navigator. To him, a canoe is more than just a form of transport. “The canoe is our island, the crew is the community and the navigator is the leader,” he says. “On a canoe, you are not just going from one place to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. Navigation is showing your crew the light of life.”","To a traditional navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands, a canoe ismuch more than just a means of transport. “The canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader,” Pittman says. He continues, “On a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds.

He continues, explaining that the converse is also true. “An island is our canoe, the community are the crew members andthe politicians and leaders are the navigators. On a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. Navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life.”"
"It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes – they are in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress. Tua’s journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September. The islanders sailed to Samoa, then Fiji, Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast. Then, they travelled south to Sydney. Around 100 crew were involved in the voyage and they tried to travel using only traditional navigation techniques. Sadly, said Tua, the crews had to use modern navigation equipment sometimes to reach Australia in time for the Congress.","It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress.

"The trip is called the Mua Voyage. It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Of ce and  ve Paci c Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji.

"The message said “We see fewer  sh than in the past, and they are smaller. And foreign  sherman take our  sh. Our coral reefs, the greatest in the world, and our  shing grounds are disappearing. Our ocean is very big but not limitless.”","The message said: “We see the signs of overexploitation. We no longer see the  sh and other marine creatures in the size, diversity or abundance of the past. We witness the change as foreign  shing  eets take our resources.Our coral reefs, the greatest in the world and our spawning grounds are disappearing. Our ocean is vast but not limitless. Growing global populations and unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life.”","In part, the message said: “We see the signs of overexploitation.

"The Paci c Islanders’ message to the delegates of the Congress was urgent. But a lot of time has been spent at the Congress trying to seta new target for the amount of the ocean that needs special protection. According to the IUCN, in 2013, less than three per cent of the world’s oceans was in marine protected areas and less than one per cent of that is ‘no take’ (no  shing). But there should be a lot more ‘no-take’ areas because the last World Parks Congress in 2003 set a target of 20-30%.","The Paci c Islanders have put a lot of effort into their urgent message to the delegates of the Congress. But, despite this, the Congress has spent much of its time trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries. Accordingto the IUCN, in 2013, the amount of the world’s oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is ‘no take’ (no  shing). This was despite a target of 20-30% no-take areas set by the last World Parks Congress in 2003.","In spite of the effort and urgency behind the Paci c Islanders’ message to the delegates of the Congress, much of the  nal days of the marine part of the Congress were taken up with trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries. According to the IUCN, as of 2013, the amount of the world’s oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is ‘no take’. This was despite a target of 20-30% no-take areas set by the last World Parks Congress held in South Africain 2003."
"After dif cult talks, the World Parks Congress agreed new targets for marine protected areas. The new target is not 20-30%; it is at least 30%. And they must try to solve the problemof biodiversity.",Marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts was one of the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003. But he said it was not enough. “The IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33%. New research shows that we need to raise the 30% target. Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans.”,"World-leading marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts from the University of York was oneof the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003. But he said it was not enough. “The IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33%. New research strengthens the case for the 30% target set previously to now be raised. Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans.”"
Tua Pittman is very happy with what the Congress has decided for the world’s oceans. “It’s a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here. To hear they made that decision is fantastic. It’s a step in the right direction.”,"After dif cult negotiations, the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically change the goals for global marine management. Instead of the 20-30% target, the IUCN now says that each marine habitat should include strictly protected areas of at least 30%. These areas should address both biodiversity and ecosystem services.","After dif cult negotiations, the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically shift the goals for global marine management. Instead of the 20-30% aspirational target, the IUCN’s new of cial position isto “urgently increase the ocean area that is effectively and equitably managed in ecologically representative and well-connected systems of MPAs [marine protected areas] or other effective conservation measures by 2030; these should include strictly protected areas that amount to at least 30% of each marine habitat and address both biodiversity and ecosystem services.”"
"He is 55 and, in his lifetime, he can already see that it is much harder to catch  sh. He also said that pollution is getting worse, particularly close to big cities such as Sydney. And climate change is already having a serious effect on Paci c Islanders. “The decisions of the big countries have a small effect on developed, large countries, but they have a very big effect onsmall countries.”",Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planet’s oceans had passed the Congress. “It’s a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard. To hear they made that resolution is fantastic.

To hear they made that resolution is fantastic. It’s a step in the right direction.” He says that, while much of the traditional navigational aids were things such as the sun, moon and stars that never changed and would, at least on a human scale, always be there, other impacts of environmental degradation were becoming clearer when voyaging across the Paci c."
"The Mua Voyage had taken years of preparation and planning. It was critical to the voyagersthat the world listened to their message and took action. Pittman said that the leaders ofrich countries should think more like traditional navigators who see that their boats are just tiny specks in an enormous sea. Most importantly, Tua says that politicians must change how they do things. “The world needs to  nd a different path.”","He said he was 55 and, in his lifetime, he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch  sh on the open ocean. He also said that pollution was getting worse, particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney. And climate change is already beginning tohave a serious effect on Paci c Islanders. “The decisions of the big countries impact on the small countries twice, three times, four times more than they impact on developed, large nations.”","He said he was 55 and, in his lifetime, he was already beginning to see that it was muchharder to catch  sh on the open ocean.

Many times, people don’t even know where our islands are and, from the eyes of a traditional navigator, our people have a very, very deep concern because we are talking about decisions made far away that impact on our homes.”"
