"A report by the World Health Organization
(WHO) says that 35.6% of all women around
the world will experience physical or sexual
violence in their lifetime, usually from a
male partner. The report says that 30% of
women are attacked by their partners. It also
says that a large percentage of murders of
women – 38% – are done by their partners.","According to a report by the World Health

partner. The report reveals the shocking extent
of attacks on women from the men with whom
they share their lives, with 30% of women being
attacked by partners. It also finds that a large
proportion of murders of women – 38% – are
carried out by their partners.","More than a third of all women worldwide –
35.6% – will experience physical or sexual
violence in their lifetime, usually from a male

study of its kind from the World Health
Organization (WHO). The report reveals the
shocking extent of attacks on women from the

"The highest levels of violence against
women are in Africa, where nearly half
of all women – 45.6% – will experience
physical or sexual violence. In poor and
middle-income Europe, the percentage is
27.2%. But, richer countries are not always
safer for women – a third of women in rich
countries (32.7%) will experience violence.
42% of the women who experience violence
have injuries, which doctors and nurses
may notice. The report says that injuries
are often the first opportunity to discover
violence in the home and to offer the woman
help. Violence has a big effect on women’s
health. Some come to hospital with broken
bones and others have problems related to
pregnancy and mental illness.","The highest levels of violence against women
are in Africa, where nearly half of all women –

low- and middle-income Europe, the proportion

always safer for women – a third of women in
high-income countries (32.7%) will experience
violence at some stage in their lives. 42% of
the women who experience violence suffer
injuries, which can bring them to the attention of
healthcare staff. That, says the report, is often
the first opportunity for violence in the home to
be discovered and for the woman to be offered
help. Violence has a significant effect on women’s
health. Some arrive at hospital with broken
bones, while others suffer pregnancy-related
complications and mental illness.","“These findings send a powerful message
that violence against women is a global health
problem of epidemic proportions,” said Dr
Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO.
“We also see that the world’s health systems
can and must do more for women who
experience violence.”"
"The WHO has two reports – one report is
on violence; the other report tells doctors
and nurses how to help women. Dr Claudia
Garcia-Moreno, of the WHO, and Professor
Charlotte Watts, from the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, wrote
the reports.","The two reports from the WHO – one is on the
extent of violence, the other offers guidelines to
healthcare staff on helping women – are the work
of Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, lead specialist in
gender, reproductive rights, sexual health and
adolescence at WHO, and Professor Charlotte
Watts, an epidemiologist who specializes in
gender, violence and health, from the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.","The highest levels of violence against women

"“For the first time we have compared data
from all over the world on partner violence
and sexual violence by non-partners and the
effect of these sorts of violence on health,”
said Garcia-Moreno. These included HIV
and other sexually transmitted infections,
depression, alcoholism, unwanted
pregnancies and babies that are born
too small.","“For the first time, we have compared data

babies.","The two reports from the WHO – one on the

"There were differences in the levels of
violence against women in different regions
of the world but, said Garcia-Moreno, “it
is too high” everywhere. Data from 81
countries shows that, even in rich countries,
23.2% of women will experience physical
and/or sexual violence from a partner in their
lives. The global figure for women attacked
by partners was 30%.","There were variations in the rates of violence

women turning to alcohol, unwanted pregnancies
and low-birthweight babies."
"Women report more sexual assaults and
rapes by acquaintances or strangers in rich
countries than elsewhere. The report says
that 12.6% of women in wealthy countries
will be sexually attacked by a non-partner
in their lives. The percentage in Africa is
11.9%.","More sexual assaults and rapes by

high-income countries than elsewhere – the

"The report says that their previous research
shows that better-educated women and
working women are less likely to experience
violence, but not in all regions. There is a
need to change some attitudes, said Watts.
“In some societies, are certain forms of
violence against women acceptable?” she
asked. “In some societies, violence against
women is not OK – but, in some societies, it
is OK.”","The authors say that their previous research
shows that better-educated women and working
women are less likely to suffer violence, although
not in all regions. There is a need to question
social norms, said Watts. “What is society’s

"Garcia-Moreno said that the percentages
show that we must pay more attention to
this question. Over the past ten years, more
people see that there is a problem, she said,
but “it is a complex problem. We don’t have
a vaccine or a pill”.","“I think the numbers are a wake-up call for all
of us to pay more attention to this issue,” said
Garcia-Moreno. Over the past ten years, there
has been increasing recognition of the problem,

complex problem. We don’t have a vaccine or
a pill”.","The authors say that their previous research

"The WHO now recommends teaching
doctors and nurses to recognize the signs
of domestic violence and sexual assault.
But they do not recommend asking every
woman who arrives in a clinic if she has
been the victim of violence.","The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines
recommend healthcare staff should be trained
to recognize the signs of domestic violence and
sexual assault, but they do not recommend
general screening – that is, asking every woman
who arrives in a clinic whether she has been
subjected to violence.","“I think the numbers are a wake-up call for all
of us to pay more attention to this issue,” said
Garcia-Moreno. Over the past decade, there

complex problem. We don’t have a vaccine or

"“If a woman comes back several times with
injuries she doesn’t mention, you should ask
her about domestic violence,” said
Garcia-Moreno.","“But, if you see a woman coming back several
times with injuries she doesn’t mention, you
should ask about domestic violence,” said
Garcia-Moreno. “When I was training in medical
school, it wasn’t something you learned or knew
about. Years later, I was sometimes in a situation
where I could tell there was something else
wrong with the woman I was interviewing, but
didn’t know that domestic violence was the
issue. Now, I think I would do the interview
very differently.”","The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines

screening – there is not a case for asking every

times with undisclosed injuries, you should be

Garcia-Moreno. “When I was training in medical

very differently.”"
