"Nobody knows which came first: the
economic crisis in Greece or shisha, the
drug that is called the “cocaine of the poor”.
But everyone agrees that shisha is a killer.
And it costs only €2 or less.","Nobody knows which came first: the economic

€2 or less a hit.","Nobody knows which came first: the economic
crisis tearing Greece apart or shisha, the drug
now known as the “cocaine of the poor”. What
everyone does accept is that shisha is a killer;
and at €2 or less a hit, it is one that has come to
stalk Greece, the country long on the frontline of
Europe’s financial meltdown."
"“It is the worst drug. It burns your insides, it
makes you aggressive and makes you go
mad,” said Maria, an ex-heroin addict. “But it
is cheap and it is easy to get, and everyone
is taking it.”","“It is the worst kind of drug. It burns your
insides, it makes you aggressive and makes
you go totally mad,” said Maria, a former heroin
addict. “But it is cheap and it is easy to get, and
it is what everyone is taking.”","“As drugs go, it is the worst. It burns your
insides, it makes you aggressive and ensures
that you go totally mad,” said Maria, a former
heroin addict. “But it is cheap and it is easy to

"This drug crisis is making problems for
Athens’s health authorities, who already
have the problem of large financial cuts.","This drug crisis has put Athens’s health
authorities, already having to deal with large
financial cuts, under further strain.","This drug crisis has put Athens’s health
authorities, already overwhelmed by draconian
cuts, under further strain."
"Thousands of homeless Greeks, who live on
the streets because of poverty and a loss of
hope, are taking shisha. The drug is related
to crystal meth. It is often mixed with battery
acid, engine oil and even shampoo. It can
make users become aggressive. And, even
worse, it is easy to buy and easy to make.","The drug of preference for thousands of
homeless Greeks forced on to the streets by
poverty and despair, shisha is described by
both addicts and officials as a drug that is
related to crystal meth. The synthetic drug is
frequently mixed with battery acid, engine oil
and even shampoo. It has the potential to send
users into a state of mindless violence. And,
even worse, it is not only easily available, but
also easy to make.","The drug of preference for thousands of
homeless Greeks forced on to the streets by
poverty and despair, shisha is described by
both addicts and officials as a variant of crystal

state of mindless violence is underpinned by

frequently mixed: battery acid, engine oil and
even shampoo."
"“It is a killer, but it also makes you want to
kill,” Konstantinos, a drug addict, said. “You
can kill without understanding that you have
done it. A lot of users have died.”","“It is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill,”
Konstantinos, a drug addict said. “You can kill
without understanding that you have done it.
And it is spreading faster than death. A lot of
users have died.”","Worse still, it is not only readily available but
easy to make – tailor-made for a society that
sees little light at the end of the tunnel."
"Charalampos Poulopoulos, the director of
Kethea, Greece’s anti-drug centre, said
shisha is an “austerity drug” – it is made by
dealers who have become clever at making
drugs for addicts who can no longer afford
heroin and cocaine.","For Charalampos Poulopoulos, the head of
Kethea, Greece’s anti-drug centre, shisha
symbolizes the crisis that has led to record
levels of destitution and unemployment. It is,
he said, an “austerity drug” – it is the response
of dealers who have become more and more
clever at producing synthetic drugs designed for
those who can no longer afford more expensive
highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine.","“It is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill,”
said Konstantinos, a drug addict. “You can kill
without understanding that you have done it. And
it is spreading faster than death. A lot of users
have died.”"
"“The crisis has given dealers the possibility
to sell a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the
poor,” said Poulopoulos. “You can sniff or
inject shisha and you can make it at home –
you don’t need any special knowledge. It is
extremely dangerous.”","“The crisis has given dealers the possibility
to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for
the poor,” said Poulopoulos at a centre for
addicts in Exarcheia, in Athens. “Shisha can be
sniffed or injected and it can be made in home
laboratories – you don’t need any specialized
knowledge. It is extremely dangerous.”","For Charalampos Poulopoulos, the head of
Kethea, Greece’s pre-eminent anti-drug centre,
shisha symbolizes the depredations of a crisis

unemployment. It is, he said, an “austerity drug”
– the response of dealers who have become
ever more adept at producing synthetic drugs
designed for those who can no longer afford
more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin
and cocaine."
"In all parts of Greece, there is a lot of
depression, and drug and alcohol abuse.
Crime has increased because austerity
measures have cut the income of ordinary
Greeks by 40%. Prostitution – the easiest
way to pay for drugs – has also increased.","Across Greece, six years of recession have
been brutal and cruel. Depression, together with
drug and alcohol abuse, has risen dramatically.
Crime has soared as a result of austerity
measures that have cut the income of ordinary
Greeks by 40%. Prostitution – the easiest way
of paying for drugs – has similarly skyrocketed.","“The crisis has given dealers the possibility
to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for
the poor,” said Poulopoulos at a centre run for
addicts in Exarcheia, the anarchist stronghold in
Athens. “Shisha can be sniffed or injected and
it can be made in home laboratories – you don’t
need any specialized knowledge. It is
extremely dangerous.”"
"There are more suicides and HIV infections,
and drug addicts (around 25,000 people)
have become more and more selfdestructive.
Sixty-four per cent of young
people in Greece are unemployed – this is
the highest youth unemployment in the EU.","“Many women agree to have unprotected
sex because that way they’ll make more
money,” said Eleni Marini, a psychologist with
Kethea. “Shisha has been linked to a very
intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability
to think clearly and we’re seeing a lot more
pregnancies among drug addicts who engage
in prostitution.” In 2012, two sex workers gave
birth on the streets of Athens.","Across Greece, the byproducts of six straight
years of recession have been brutal and cruel.
Depression, along with drug and alcohol abuse,
has risen dramatically. Delinquency and crime
have soared as Greek society has unravelled
under the weight of austerity measures that
have cut the income of ordinary Greeks by 40%.
Prostitution – the easiest way of financing drug
addiction – has similarly skyrocketed."
"At the time when organizations such as
Kethea need extra help, the Greek state
has cut by a third the money it gives them.
The European Commission, European
Central Bank and International Monetary
Fund asked them to do this to help save the
Greek economy.","As the number of suicides has also increased
and HIV infections are spreading, drug addicts
(a population believed to be around 25,000)
have become increasingly self-destructive. And,
experts say, young Greeks marginalized by
record rates of unemployment – at 64% Greece
has the highest youth unemployment in the EU
– are leading the way.","“Desperation is such that many women agree
to engage in unprotected sex because that way
they’ll make more money,” said Eleni Marini, a
British-trained psychologist with Kethea. “Shisha
has been linked to a very intense sexual drive
but it attacks your ability to think straight and
we’re seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug
addicts who engage in prostitution.” In 2012, two
sex workers gave birth on the streets of Athens."
"Since the economic crisis began in 2009,
Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff. They get
less money, but studies show that for every
euro the Greek state spends on anti-drug
programmes such as Kethea, it saves about
€6 because there is less crime and fewer
health problems. “The cuts are a huge
mistake,” said Poulopoulos.","“The crisis has created a widespread sense of
pessimism,” said Poulopoulos. “For those who
might have stopped taking drugs, there is now
no incentive. Instead, there’s an atmosphere of
misery, where people who know they won’t find
work are becoming a lot more self-destructive.
In Athens, where the economic crisis has hit
hardest, shisha is part of that.”","At a time when suicides have also shot up

"On the streets of Athens, there is a fear that
austerity not only doesn’t work – it kills.","Just when the need for help has never been

,"Since the financial crisis began in 2009, Kethea
has lost 70 of its 500 staff. The cuts come
despite studies that show that, for every euro
they spend on anti-drug programmes such as
Kethea, the Greek state saves about €6 in costs
to the criminal justice and healthcare systems.
“The cuts we have witnessed are a false
economy, a huge mistake,” said Poulopoulos.","Greece’s conservative-dominated coalition
government has tried to deal with the problem by
driving drug users and other homeless people
out of the city centre – a series of controversial
police operations has swept central streets,
clearing crowded doorways and malls."
,"On the streets of Athens, where shisha is
growing in popularity, there is a fear that
austerity not only doesn’t work – it kills.","“But with such actions, authorities are only
sweeping the problem under the carpet,” said Poulopoulos. “What, in reality, they are really
doing is marginalizing these people even more
by pushing them into the arms of drug dealers
who offer them protection.”"
,,"Just when the demand for help has never been
greater, state-funded organizations such as
Kethea have had their budgets slashed by a third
