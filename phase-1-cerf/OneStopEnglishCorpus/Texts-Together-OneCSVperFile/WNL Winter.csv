"Maria laughs when asked if she has enough money. “There is no work in the winter, only in the summer,” says Maria.

"Housing is the biggest cost in the Hamptons. Larry Cantwell, who has lived in East Hampton all his life, says homes often cost more than $25 million. “It is very dif cult to  nd your  rst home here,” Cantwell says. “If you can  nd a hometo buy anywhere in East Hampton for less than $500,000, you’re very lucky.”","Littman says that, when she talks to the people who come for the summer about the food pantries, they are always shocked because they know only the glamorous side of the Hamptons where there are big parties and the beaches and mansions.","“Once Labor Day comes and the season is over and people’s hours start to be cut back, our numbers go up to about 400 families a week,” she says. “When they come to us on Tuesday, they get two to three days’ worth of food. Without us, they would struggle that much more."""
"Cantwell says more than half the town’s homes are empty for most of the year. The population goes from 80,000 in August to 10,000 in the winter months.","“But, what people don’t realize is that there is that service industry. It’s the landscapers, the nannies, the waitresses – they all rely on what they earn in the summer to survive the winter.”","Littman says it can be hard for outsiders to realize that there are people struggling to get by in a place known the world over for its excess. “When I discuss with the summer community that comes out here about the food pantries, they’re always shocked because there is that glamorous side of the Hamptons where there are galas and the beaches and the mansions that are here."
"“There’s a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer,” says Cantwell, the son of a  sherman father and a house-cleaner mother. “But, the rest of us live here all year.”"," Littman says the town has lost too many people who do important jobs – such as teachers, police of cers and even doctors and dentists – because they can’t afford to live in the community."," “But, what people don’t realize is that there is that service industry.

 “There are famous and very wealthy people but also hard-working and poor people. You’ve got to remember that this used to be a farming and  shing community – a real working-class community.”," Housing is the biggest cost in the Hamptons. Larry Cantwell, who has lived in East Hampton all his life, says homes regularly change hands for more than $25m. “Finding your  rst home is a challenge in an area like this,” Cantwell says. “If you can  nd a home to buy anywhere in East Hampton for $500,000, you’re very lucky.”","“There are seniors who have to sometimes pick between whether they are going to pay for their medications or pay their bills or buy food, and that shouldn’t be the case.”"
"Eddie Vallone, 22, says, “People only see the Hamptons as a rich town but there are a lot of problems here, especially drugs. It’s hard to understand. You think, ‘OK, the summer is over.

"Vallone works cleaning swimming pools. He says that, if he is careful, he can make his summer earnings last until November. “But, work doesn’t start again until May or the beginning of June.”"," “There’s certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer,” says Cantwell, the son of a  sherman father and a house-cleaner mother. “But, the rest of us live here year round.","Housing is, by far, the biggest cost in the Hamptons. At $147m, the nation’s most expensive property is hedge fund manager Barry Rosenstein’s 18-acre beachfront estate at 67 Further Lane, a stone’s throw from Maidstone Golf Club, which is considered “the most elite, prestigious and dif cult to get into” of all the Hamptons clubs."

If you can  nd a home to buy anywhere in East Hampton for $500,000, you’re very lucky.”"

,,Being homeless in the Hamptons means spending a lot of time on a bus. Various houses of worship have joined together to ensure there is somewhere for the homeless to spend the night over the winter. Churches up and down the north and south fork of Long Island take on the burden one night at a time and roughly 50 homeless people are bussed between them every day.
,,"Eddie Vallone, 22, is one of those on the bus every night. “People look at the Hamptons as some sort of rich town and there’s no problems going on. But there are a lot of problems here, especially drugs."
,,"""It’s hard to really grasp – ‘OK, the summer is coming to an end. What am I going to do for the winter?’” Vallone says at Maureen’s Haven, a charity that coordinates the homeless shelter programme. “I want to work but there’s no work to be done.”"
