"John Spencer, a mission scientist, said that one
of the biggest surprises was the discovery that
“there are mountains in the Kuiper belt”. The
Kuiper belt is the solar system’s mysterious “third
zone” where Pluto is, with about 100,000 smaller
icy objects. He said the mountains are around
3,000 metres high and several hundred
miles across.","One of the biggest surprises was the discovery

"Pluto used to be the ninth planet but, since 2006,
it has been a dwarf planet. The NASA press
conference began with spectacular images of the
sun and the eight official planets.","The detailed image of one edge of the dwarf
planet showed not a single crater. This
tells scientists that there has been recent
geological activity on the surface, which could
include dramatic geysers throwing ice into the
atmosphere or cryo-volcanoes that erupt in
explosions of ice.","The detailed image of one edge of the dwarf

explosions of ice rather than molten rock."

just the beginning and that we would learn more
about the planet soon. Scientists believe the
mountains on Pluto are made from water ice with
just a thin cover of methane and nitrogen.","Pluto used to be the ninth planet but, since 2006,
it has been known as a dwarf planet. The NASA

"“Water ice is strong enough to hold up big
mountains.” The images are the first to show ice

and nitrogen. “You can’t make mountains out of
methane and nitrogen,” said Spencer."
"The images are so detailed that, if the spacecraft
flew over London, we would be able to see the
runways at Heathrow airport.","“Water ice is strong enough to hold up big
mountains and that’s what we think we can see
here. This is the first time we’ve seen this. The
methane and nitrogen are just a coating.” The
mountains on Pluto probably formed no more
than 100m years ago – extremely recently in the
4.56bn-year-old solar system. This suggests the
region, which covers about 1% of Pluto’s surface,
may still be geologically active. The images are

1% of Pluto’s surface, may still be geologically
active. The images are the first to show ice
mountains outside of the moons of giant planets

process could be generating the mountainous
landscape."
"It is five billion kilometres to Pluto. This means it
takes New Horizons hours to send back a picture
and it will take 16 months to send back all the
data. The team also said that the heart-shaped
area on Pluto will be called the Tombaugh Regio,
after Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf
planet in 1930.","The images are so detailed that, if the craft were
flying over London, we would be able to see the
runways at Heathrow airport.","The structures, together with the smoothness of
Pluto’s surface, suggest that geological activity
is taking place and smoothing over depressions
caused by asteroid impacts. Scientists believe
this “paving” process could be the result of
internal heat that softens rock and ice or from
snowfalls that cover the surface. For scale, the
images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying
over London, we would be able to pick out the
runways at Heathrow airport."
"The image of Charon shows an area of cliffs
about 1,000km long. The image also shows a
dramatic canyon 7 to 9km deep.","The distance to Pluto – 5bn km – means it takes

"Cathy Olkin, a mission scientist, said: “Charon
just blew our socks off when we saw the new
image. The team is so excited.”","The new view of Charon reveals an area of
cliffs stretching about 1,000km. This suggests
