"We all know about wildlife emergencies such
as the possible extinction of the tiger in India,
the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda.
Everybody loves these animals and no one
wants to see them disappear. But, now, scientists
are worried that the threat to creatures such as
ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity.","We have all become familiar with wildlife
emergencies such as the threatened extinction of

fear the real impact of declining wildlife could
be closer to home – they believe the threat to

"Climate change, falling numbers of animals,
rising numbers of humans and extinction mean
that more and more scientists now believe that
we are in the Anthropocene age – the age
of extinction.","Climate change, falling numbers of animals, rising
numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species

"A recent report from the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF) confirms that worrying idea – statistics
from the report show a very big reduction in
the numbers of many species. The number of
vertebrates has declined by 52% over the last
forty years. We are losing too many species.
Some populations of mammals, birds, reptiles
and amphibians have reduced even more, with
freshwater species declining by 76% over the
same period. But it’s the creatures that help
us the most that are worrying many scientists.
Three quarters of the world’s food production
depends on bees and other insects. Pandas are
cute and tigers are beautiful but other animals
are more useful – it’s worms that turn our waste
into nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and
keep malaria rates down.","A recent report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
confirmed that worrying picture, with statistics
on the world’s wildlife population that showed a
dramatic reduction in numbers across numerous
species. The report showed the number of
vertebrates had declined by 52% over four
decades. Biodiversity loss has now reached
“critical levels”. Some populations of mammals,
birds, reptiles and amphibians have suffered
even bigger losses, with freshwater species
declining by 76% over the same period. But it’s
the creatures that provide the most “ecosystem
services” that are getting many scientists really
worried. Three quarters of the world’s food
production is thought to depend on bees and
other pollinators. Pandas may be cute and tigers
beautiful but it’s worms that turn our waste into
nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and
keep malaria rates down.","WWF’s Living Planet Index (LPI) 2014 seemed
to confirm that grim picture, with statistics on
the world’s wildlife population that showed a
dramatic reduction in numbers across countless
species. The LPI showed the number of
vertebrates had declined by 52% over four
decades. Biodiversity loss has now reached
“critical levels”. Some populations of mammals,
birds, reptiles and amphibians have suffered
even bigger losses, with freshwater species

it’s the creatures that provide the most “natural
capital” or “ecosystem services” that are getting
many scientists really worried. Three quarters of
the world’s food production is thought to depend
on bees and other pollinators such as hoverflies.
Never mind how cute a panda is or how
stunning a tiger – it’s worms that are grinding
up our waste and taking it deep into the soil to
turn into nutrients, and bats that are catching
mosquitoes and keeping malaria rates down. A
study in North America has valued the loss of
pest control from ongoing bat declines at more
than $22bn in lost agricultural productivity."
"“It’s the loss of the common species that will
affect people. The loss of the rarer creatures
will not affect us much because we’re not reliant
on them in such an obvious way,” said Dr Nick
Isaac, who studies the environment. He says
that Britain’s insects and other invertebrates are
declining just as fast as vertebrates. He says that
this will cause serious problems for humans.","“It’s the loss of the common species that
will impact on people, not so much the rarer
creatures – because they are so rare, we’re
not reliant on them in such an obvious way,”
said macroecologist Dr Nick Isaac. He says
that recent work he and colleagues have been
doing suggests that Britain’s insects and other
invertebrates are declining just as fast as
vertebrates, with “serious consequences for
humanity”. “The really interesting thing about
this work is that we are learning that it’s not just
about the numbers of species going extinct,
but the actual numbers in a population; that’s
the beginning of a fundamental shift in our
understanding,” he says.","“It’s the loss of the common species that

"He said that between 23% and 36% of all birds,
mammals and amphibians that we use for food
or medicine might become extinct. In many parts
of the world, wild animals are an important part of
the diet, particularly for the poor.","He pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36%

"Most people also blame humans – humans
damage ecosystems, create climate change and
destroy habitats. But, this time, it’s not just the
“big, cuddly mammals” we have to worry about
losing but the smaller creatures that are less easy
to see. We depend on insects, creepy-crawlies
and even worms. They might not become extinct
very soon, but a decline in their numbers will
affect us all. “We are going to feel the effect of
those losses. The numbers of both invertebrates
and vertebrates are declining. It’s not so simple
as ‘fish die and people starve’ – it’s more
complex,” said Isaac.","The blame, most people agree, is unsustainable
human consumption damaging ecosystems,
creating climate change and destroying habitats
at a far faster rate than previously thought. But,
this time, it’s not just the “big, cuddly mammals”
we have to worry about losing but the smaller,
less visible creatures upon which we depend –
insects, creepy-crawlies and even worms. They
might not be facing immediate extinction but a
decline in their numbers will affect us all. “We are
going to feel the impact of those losses. With the
UK species, the pattern is much the same with
invertebrates as it is with vertebrates. It’s not as
simplistic as ‘fish die and people starve’ – it’s
more complex,” said Isaac.","The blame, most agree, sits with unsustainable

"Humans, said TV naturalist Sir David
Attenborough in 2013, are a “plague on earth”.
But the WWF claims there is still time to stop the
decline. Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum
said: “The amount of destruction shown in this
report should make us all change our behaviour.
We all – politicians, business and people – have
a responsibility to protect what we all value: a
healthy future for people and nature.","Humans, said TV naturalist Sir David

"“Humans are cutting down too many trees too
quickly, fishing too many fish, taking too much
water from our rivers and producing too much
carbon,” he said.","“Humans are cutting down trees more quickly
than they can regrow, harvesting more fish than
the oceans can restock, pumping water from
our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can fill
them again and emitting more carbon than the
oceans and forests can absorb,” he said.","“Humans are cutting down trees more quickly
