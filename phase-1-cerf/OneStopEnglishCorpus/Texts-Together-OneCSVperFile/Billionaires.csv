"Oxfam said the world could end poverty
several times over if the richest 100
billionaires would give away the money they
made in 2012.","The charity said the accumulation of
wealth and income often led to a reduction

poorest people. This made it more difficult
for people who survive on aid or low
wages to improve their situation and
escape poverty.","The charity said the accumulation of wealth and

expense of secure jobs and decent wages for
the poorest, undermined the ability of people

money they give each year.","Without naming anyone, the charity argued

billionaires do not give away money to
charity in the same way that US
billionaires do.","It is unusual for charities to attack the

inefficient, politically corrosive, socially divisive
and environmentally destructive”."
