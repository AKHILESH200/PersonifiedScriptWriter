"Our new international survey, including 33 countries, shows how wrong people around the world are about some important things.",Our new international survey across 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about key social realities.,Our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities.
"British people think the richest 1% own 59% of their country’s wealth, when they actually “only” own 23%. Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants but it is really only 14%.","British people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their country’s wealth, when they actually “only” own 23%.

"In Britain, people think that 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. In India, people who did the online survey think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when really only 19% do.","In Britain, people think that 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%.

"So, why do people across the world know so little about these things?",Why are people across the world so often clueless about these realities?,Why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities?
"Some of us don’t understand the questions. For example, most countries overestimate how many people are not religious: in the 33 countries, people thought 37% are not religious but the real number is actually just 18%. This is because we are thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than how many people say they have a religion.","It is partly that we just struggle with basicmaths and some of us clearly misunderstandthe questions or interpret them differently. For example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people are not religious: across the33 countries, respondents think that 37% are not religious but the average is actually just 18%. This is because we are thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than how many people see themselves as having a religion.","It is partly that we just struggle with basicmaths and some of us clearly misunderstandthe questions or interpret them differently. For example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not af liate themselves with a religion: across the 33 countries, 37% do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually just 18%. This will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than what they put oncensus forms."
"Rural areas are large so that is why people overestimate how many people live inthe countryside.","People also take mental shortcuts, where they take easily available information even if it doesn’t quite  t the question. Our huge overestimatesof the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how large rural areas are, rather than a careful calculation of how many people live in them. In Daniel Kahneman’s terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of “fast” thinking, rather than “slow”.","People also take mental shortcuts, wherethey grab for easily available information even if it doesn’t quite  t the question. Our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up, rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupiedit generally is. In Daniel Kahneman’s terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of “fast” thinking, rather than “slow”."
"We see things from our own perspective and  nd it dif cult to imagine that there is a lot of variety in our countries. For example, the people from India who did the survey really overestimated their population’s access to the internet. Most people did the study online – and, in developing countries, this means the people who did the survey were probably wealthy. What we found from the survey is that people generalize from their own situations and forget that other people’s situations might be different.","We see things from our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries. This was highlighted by our Indian respondents who massively overestimated their population’s access to the internet. Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey – and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more wealthy, connected group rather than the general population. What we  nd throughout the study is that people generalize from their own situations and forget how unrepresentative they are.","We are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries, as highlighted by our Indian sample’s massively overestimating their population’s access tothe internet. Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey – and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more af uent, connected group rather than the population as a whole. In some ways, we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality – those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions. But what we  nd, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are."
"In Britain, this is probably the reason why people overestimated how much the richest peopleown, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%). People are worried about these things and, because of this, they overestimate.",We suffer from what social psychologists call “emotional innumeracy” when we are estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers.,"We suffer from what social psychologists call “emotional innumeracy” when estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. Cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creatingour concern."
"But, the survey suggests there are also some problems that people are not very worried about but they should be more worried. For example, most countries really underestimate how much of their population is overweight. The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are overweight, when 71% are. Britons think it is 44%, when actually 62% are overweight.","For Britain, worries are part of the explanation for people’s huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%). People are worried about these things and, because of this, they overestimate how big the problems are.","For Britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for people’s huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to of cial estimates). People are worried about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels, and this is re ected in them overstating the scale of the issues."
"In many ways, it is the differences between countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. The top 1% in Russia own 70% of the nation’s wealth, while the top 1% in New Zealand only own 18%. Half of Italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents but only 4% in Norway. The average age in India is 27; it is 47 in Japan. Only 10% of politicians are women in Brazil, Hungary and Japan, when 44% are in Sweden.","But, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. For example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. Britons think it is 44% when it is actually nearly half as much again – 62% are either overweight or obese.","But, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be.

"When the reality is so strange and varied, it is not surprising that we’re often so wrong.","And, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. The top 1% in Russia own 70% of the nation’s wealth while the top 1% in New Zealand only own 18%. Half of Italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in Norway.
