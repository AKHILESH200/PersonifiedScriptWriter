"Flappy Bird
Dong Nguyen, the inventor of the mobile game
Flappy Bird, removed it from app stores. It was
downloaded more than 50 million times and
was making him around £30,000 each day.
He said its success ruined his simple life. On
Twitter, he said: “I cannot live like
this anymore.”
Nguyen is the latest inventor who wishes he
hadn’t created a monster.","Flappy Bird
Be careful what you wish for, especially if you
want to invent something new. Recently, Dong
Nguyen, the designer of the mobile game
Flappy Bird, removed it from app stores. He
said its success – it had been downloaded
more than 50 million times and was making
him around £30,000 from advertising each
day – had ruined his simple life. On his Twitter
account, he said: “I cannot take this anymore.”
OK, so regretting making Flappy Bird isn’t
quite the same as regretting making a rifl e, but
Nguyen is just the latest inventor who wished
he hadn’t created a monster.","Flappy Bird

"The labradoodle
The labradoodle isn’t a monster – it’s lovely.
But what’s monstrous is the way people sell
crossbreed dogs since the labradoodle’s
inventor, Wally Conron, fi rst created the dog
in the 1980s. “I’ve created a lot of problems”,
he said. “There are a lot of unhealthy and
abandoned dogs now.” Conron invented the
labradoodle when he was working for the
Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia. He
invented it as a dog for a blind woman. Her
husband was allergic to dog hair. He didn’t
know that the labradoodle would become
so popular.","The labradoodle

with the labradoodle when he was working for

types of poodle-cross dogs, many of which have
health problems – would become so popular.","The labradoodle

"The AK-47
Six months before his death in December
2013, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the
assault rifl e, wrote to the head of the Russian
Orthodox Church and asked: “If my rifl e killed
people, am I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 93 years
old, the son of a poor farmer, Christian and
Orthodox, responsible for people’s deaths,
even if they were enemies?”","The AK-47

"Electronic tagging
The electronic tag was fi rst made in the 1960s
to check if ex-prisoners went to school or work,
and to reward them for good behaviour. Its
inventors, Bob Gable and his brother Kirkland,
were later horrifi ed that the tag became a form
of control and punishment. “It’s not pleasant,”
Kirkland Gable said in 2010, “but I’m not in
control of the universe. I have to realize there
are some things out of my control.”","Electronic tagging

"Pepper spray
After police sprayed peaceful protesters with
pepper spray at a University of California
campus in 2011, Kamran Loghman, one of
the scientists who helped develop the spray
in the 80s said, “I have never seen such an
inappropriate use of chemicals.”","Pepper spray

"The offi ce cubicle
In the late 60s, a new kind of offi ce was made
to give workers privacy and increase how
well and how quickly people work by giving
more work space. But the cubicle became
a way for companies to put employees into
smaller spaces. The inventor, Bob Propst,
said, in 1997, “the use of cubicles in modern
companies is crazy.”","The offi ce cubicle
