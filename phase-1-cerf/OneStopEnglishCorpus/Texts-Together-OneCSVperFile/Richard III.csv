"A team at Leicester University has told the
world that the body they found under a local
car park is the body of King Richard III.
There were cheers when Richard Buckley,
leader of the team of archaeologists, finally
said that they were certain they had found
the body of the king.","An extraordinary press conference at Leicester
University has revealed the identity of the
man in the car park with the twisted spine. It
has also revealed his appalling last moments
and the humiliating treatment of his body in
the hours after his death. There were cheers

with the twisted spine, but the appalling last

"The evidence is very strong. The scientists
who did the DNA tests, the people who
created the computer-imaging technology
to look at the bones in extraordinary detail,
the genealogists who found a distant
descendant with matching DNA, and the
academics who read old texts looking for
accounts of the king’s death and burial all
gave their findings.","The evidence was overwhelming. The
scientists who carried out the DNA tests, those
who created the computer-imaging technology

texts for accounts of the king’s death and
burial all reported their findings.","There were cheers when Richard Buckley,
Lead Archaeologist on the hunt for the king’s
body, finally announced that the university
team was convinced “beyond reasonable
doubt” that it had found the last Plantagenet
king, bent by scoliosis of the spine, and twisted
further to fit into a hastily dug hole in Grey
Friars church, which was slightly too small to
hold his body."
"Work has started on designing a new tomb
in Leicester Cathedral, only 100 yards from
the excavation site. There will be a ceremony
to lay him into his new grave there, probably
next year. Leicester’s Museums’ Service is
working on plans for a new visitor centre in
an old school building next to the site.","Work has started on designing a new tomb in

"Richard died at the Battle of Bosworth on
22 August 1485, the last English king to die
in battle. The researchers revealed how he
died for the first time. One picture showed
the bottom of his skull cut off by one terrible
hit, probably from a razor-sharp iron axe.
The axe probably went several centimetres
into his brain and, experts say, he would
have been unconscious at once and dead
very soon.","Richard died at Bosworth on 22 August 1485,

the first time, the researchers revealed how.
There was an intake of breath as a picture
showed the base of his skull sliced off by
one terrible hit, probably from a razor-sharp
iron axe blade on a wooden pole. The blade
probably went several centimetres into his
brain and, experts say, he was certainly
unconscious at once and dead almost as soon.","“What a morning. What a story,” said Philippa
Langley, of the Richard III Society. She had
been driving on the project for years, in the
face of incredulity from many people, and
finding funds from all over the world when it
looked as if the money would run out before
the excavation had even begun."
"The injury confirms the story that he died in
the middle of the battle without his horse.
In Shakespeare’s play, he cries: “A horse! A
horse! My kingdom for a horse!” Another hit
with a sword, which also went through the
bone and into the brain, would also have
killed him. But many of the other injuries
were after death, which suggests that the
king’s naked body was mutilated as it was
brought back to Leicester.","The injury confirms the story that he died in the

"One terrible injury was certainly after death
and could not have happened when his
lower body was protected by armour. It
suggests the story that his naked corpse
was brought back on a horse and mutilated
is true. Bob Savage, a medieval weapons
expert, said it was probably not a war
weapon. It was probably the sort of sharp
knife a workman normally carried.","One terrible injury was certainly after death

There was an audible intake of breath as a
slide came up showing the base of his skull

from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle
weapon with a razor-sharp iron axe blade
weighing about two kilos, mounted on a
wooden pole, which was swung at Richard
at very close range. The blade probably
penetrated several centimetres into his brain
and, said the human bones expert Jo Appleby,
he would have been unconscious at once and
dead almost as soon."
"Michael Ibsen, identified as the descendant
of Richard’s sister, was shocked when he
heard the confirmation on Sunday. “My head
is still not clear now,” he said. “Many, many
hundreds of people died on that field that
day. He was a king, but just one of the dead.
He lived in very violent times and these
deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”","Michael Ibsen, the Canadian-born furniture
maker proved to be the descendant of Richard’s
sister, heard the confirmation on Sunday and
listened to the evidence in shocked silence. “My
head is no clearer now than when I first heard
the news,” he said. “Many, many hundreds of
people died on that field that day. He was a
king, but just one of the dead. He lived in very
violent times and these deaths would not have
been pretty or quick.”","The injury appears to confirm contemporary
accounts that he died in close combat in the
thick of the battle and unhorsed – as in the
great despairing cry Shakespeare gives him:
“A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”
Another sword slash, which also went through
the bone and into the brain, would also have
proved fatal. But many of the other injuries
were after death, suggesting a gruesome ritual
on the battlefield and as the king’s body was
brought back to Leicester, as he was stripped,
mocked and mutilated."
"It was Mathew Morris who first found the
body, in the first hour of the first day of the
excavation. At first, he did not believe it was
the king. He was digging in the car park, a
place that local historians and the Richard III
Society said was probably the site of the lost
church of Grey Friars. The priests of Grey
Friars were brave – they took the body of
the king and buried him in their church.","It was Mathew Morris who first uncovered

historians and the Richard III Society as the
probable site of the lost church of Grey Friars.
The priests of Grey Friars bravely took the
body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug
grave, probably still naked, but in a position of
honour near the high altar of their church. The
leg bones, which were just showing through
the soil, were covered up again.","One terrible injury, a stab through the right
buttock and into his pelvis, was certainly after
death and could not have happened when

and abused all the way, is true. Bob Savage,
a medieval arms expert from the Royal
Armouries who helped identify the wounds,
said it was probably not a war weapon but the
sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman
might have carried."
"Ten days later, on 5 September, when more
excavation proved Morris had found the right
place, he returned with Lin Foxhall, head of
the archaeology department, to excavate
the body. “We did it the usual way, lifting the
arms, legs and skull first, and then we lifted
the torso – so it was only when we finally
saw the twisted spine that I thought: ‘My
word, I think we’ve found him.’”","Ten days later, on 5 September, when further

"For Philippa Langley of the Richard III
Society, Richard was the true king, the last
king of the north, a worthy and brave leader
who was a victim of Shakespeare’s negative
propaganda. Many people still believe he
killed the little princes in the tower: the child
Edward V and his brother Richard, were
kept as prisoners in the Tower of London
when Richard III became king and they were
never seen alive again. Some bones were
found at the tower centuries later, but it is
not certain they are the princes’. There may
be a need for more DNA detective
work there.","For Philippa Langley of the Richard III Society,
