The researchers were surprised by what people would do to avoid the task. What was the task? To sit in a chair and do nothing but think.,What surprised researchers was not how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it. The task? To sit in a chair and do nothing but think.,It was not so much how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it that left researchers gobsmacked. The task? To sit in a chair and do nothing but think.
Some people found it so unbearable that they gave themselves mild electric shocks to stop the boredom.,Some found it so unbearable that they took the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks to break the tedium.,So unbearable did some  nd it that they took up the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks in an attempt to break the tedium.
Two-thirds of men pressed a button that gave them a painful shock during a 15-minute period of solitude. A quarter of women also pressed the shock button.,Two-thirds of men pressed a button that gave them a painful shock during a 15-minute period of solitude.,Two-thirds of men pressed a button to deliver a painful jolt during a 15-minute spell of solitude.
The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities looks at the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.,"Under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button. The difference, scientists suspect, is that men are typically more sensation-seeking than women.","Under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button.

"In more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that all kinds of people hated being left alone to think – it doesn’t matter what their age, education or income is, or how often they use smartphones or social media.",The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities tries to answer the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.,The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.
"Researcher Timothy Wilson said that the results were probably not because of the speed of modern life or because of mobile phones and social media. Instead, he said those things might be popular because we feel we need to do something and hate doing nothing.","In more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent on smartphones or social media.","In more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent using smartphones or social media."
"During the  rst experiments, students were taken into a room and told to think. They were alone, without their phones, books or anything to write with. The only rules were that they had to stay sitting and not fall asleep. They were told that they would have six to 15 minutes alone.","Timothy Wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily due to the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media. Instead, those things might be popular because of our constant need to do something rather than nothing.","Timothy Wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily a re ection ofthe pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media. Instead, those things might be popular because of our constant urge to do something rather than nothing."
"The students were questioned at the end ofthe experiment. Most of them did not enjoy the experience. They found it dif cult to concentrate and their minds wandered.","In the  rst experiments, students were taken – alone, without phones, books or anything to write with – into a room and told to think. The only rules were that they had to stay seated and not fall asleep. They were told that they would have six to 15 minutes alone.","The  rst run of experiments began with students being ushered – alone, without phones, books or anything to write with – into an unadorned room and told to think. The only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep. They were informed – speci cally or vaguely – that they would have six to 15 minutes alone."
"The researchers did the experiment againwith people at home. They got similar results. Surprisingly, people found it even more dif cult and they cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones.","The students were questioned when the time was up. On average, they did not enjoy the experience. They struggled to concentrate. Their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them.","The students were questioned when the time was up. On average, they did not enjoy the experience. They struggled to concentrate. Their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them. Even giving them time to think about what to think about did not help."
"The researchers did the study again with more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers’ market. They also disliked just sitting and thinking.","In case the unfamiliar setting reduced the ability to think, the researchers did the experiment again with people at home.","In case the unfamiliar setting hampered the ability to think, the researchers ran the experiment again with people at home."
"But, there was an even more surprising result. To check if people might prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students had the possibility of giving themselves a mild electric shock.","They got similar results. In fact, people foundthe experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones.","They got much the same results, only people found the experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones."
"Before the experiment, all the students said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks.","To see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists tested more than 100 other people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers’ market. They also disliked being left to their thoughts.","To see if the effect was found only instudents, the scientists recruited more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers’ market. They, too, disliked being left to their thoughts."
But 12 of 18 men gave themselves electric shocks and six of 24 women gave themselves electric shocks.,"But, the most surprising result was yet to come. To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of giving themselves a mild electric shock.","But, the most staggering result was yet to come. To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of administering a mild electric shock."
"The scientists were surprised. They said that being alone with their thoughts was so hard for many participants that they gave themselves an electric shock, something the participants had said they would pay not to get.","They had been asked earlier to say how unpleasant the shocks were, compared to other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle.","They had been asked earlier to rate how unpleasant the shocks were, alongside other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle."
"Jessica Andrews-Hanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to make a boring lecture more exciting. But, she says we need to know more about Wilson’s study.",All the students chosen for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks.,All the students picked for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks after receiving a demonstration.
"“Imagine – a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button thatwill give them a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts,” she said.","To the researchers’ surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks and six of 24 women did the same.","To the researchers’ surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks, as did six of 24 women."
"“As they sit there, their mind starts to wander and naturally they think about that shock – was it really that bad?”",The scientists said that the most surprising thing was that being alone with their thoughts was so hard for many people that they gave themselves an electric shock – something the participants had earlier said they would pay to avoid.,"“What is striking is that simply being alone with their thoughts was apparently so aversive that it drove many participants to self-administeran electric shock that they had earlier said they would pay to avoid,” the scientists writein Science."

But, she says we need to know more about the motivation of the shockers in Wilson’s study.","Jessica Andrews-Hanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably zap themselves to cheer up a tedious lecture.
