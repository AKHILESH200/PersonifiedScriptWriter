"You’ve spent eight hours in the office. You’ve
finished the most important work of the day. This
is the time when most workers would think about
going home.","You’ve spent eight hours in the office. The most
important work of the day is done; whatever is left
can wait until the morning. This is the point many
workers would think about heading for the door.","The regulation eight hours in the office is over.
The most important work of the day is done;

"But, for millions of Japanese employees, if they
leave work and arrive home in time for dinner,
people say that they are disloyal to
their company.","But, for millions of Japanese employees, the
thought of leaving their desks and being at home
in time for dinner is enough to make people
accuse them of disloyalty.","Yet, for millions of Japanese employees, the
thought of clearing away their desks and being
at home in time for dinner is enough to invite
accusations of disloyalty."
"But now, the government is trying to do
something about Japan’s culture of overwork. It
wants to make workers take at least five days’
paid holiday a year.","For decades, the government has allowed
companies to make sure their workforce is as
productive as possible. But, now, it is challenging
Japan’s culture of overwork. The government
is considering making it a legal requirement for
workers to take at least five days’ paid holiday
a year.","But, after decades of giving companies carte
blanche to milk every last drop of productivity
from their workforce, a challenge to Japan’s
ingrained culture of overwork has come from the
government, which is considering making it a
legal requirement for workers to take at least five
days’ paid holiday a year."
"Japanese employees are allowed an average of
18.5 days’ paid holiday a year. Companies must
allow them a minimum of ten days’ paid holiday,
plus 15 one-day national holidays. But very few
employees take these days. Most take only nine
days of holiday, according to the labour ministry.
Many British workers think that a two-week
summer holiday is their right but workers in Japan
think that a four-night vacation in Hawaii is a
big self-indulgence.","Japanese employees are currently entitled to an
average 18.5 days’ paid holiday a year – only two
fewer than the global average – with a minimum
of ten days, as well as 15 one-day national
holidays. In reality, very few employees take
these days. Most use only nine of their 18.5-day
average entitlement, according to the labour
ministry. While many British workers see a
two-week summer holiday as their right, workers
in Japan think that a four-night vacation in Hawaii
is complete self-indulgence.","Japanese employees are currently entitled to
an average 18.5 days’ paid holiday a year –
only two fewer than the global average – with
a minimum of ten days, as well as 15 one-day
national holidays. In reality, few come even close
to taking their full quota, typically using only nine
of their 18.5-day average entitlement, according
to the labour ministry. While many British workers
regard a two-week summer holiday as an
inalienable right, workers in Japan have come to
see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height
of self-indulgence."
"By 2020, the government hopes that the law will
make Japanese employees follow the example of
British workers, who take an average of 20 days’
paid annual leave, and workers in France, who
take an average of 25.","By the end of the decade, the government hopes
that the law will push Japanese employees
towards following the example set by British
workers, who use an average of 20 days’ paid
annual leave, and those in France, who take an
average of 25.","The move, to be debated in the current
parliamentary session, comes after companies
started encouraging employees to nap on the job
to improve their performance."
"Japan’s employees are respected and admired
in the rest of the world for their commitment to
the company. But they often have no time for
anything else.","Japan’s tough work culture helped turn it into an
economic superpower, its employees respected
and admired in the rest of the world for their
commitment to the company, but they have little
time to do anything except work.","By the end of the decade, the government hopes
that, if passed, the law will push Japanese
employees towards following the example set by
British workers, who use an average of 20 days’
paid annual leave, and those in France, who take
an average of 25."
"Couples don’t have time to start families. So,
Japan has a low birth rate and the population
is declining. More employees are falling ill from
stress or even dying through overwork.","Japan’s low birth rate and population decline are
partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to
start families. More employees are falling ill from
stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death
through overwork.","Japan’s unforgiving work culture may have
helped turn it into an economic superpower, its
corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the
world for their commitment to the company, but
this has often been to the exclusion of
everything else."
"About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours
a week, compared with 16% of US workers and
11% in France and Germany, according to data
from the Japanese government.","Japanese people continue to work hard, despite
studies that suggest that longer hours in the
office or workshop or on the factory floor do not
necessarily make people more productive.","Japan’s low birth rate and predictions of rapid
population decline are partly blamed on the
lack of time couples have to start families. More
employees are falling ill from stress, or worse,
succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork."
"“Nobody else uses their vacation days,” says
Erika Sekiguchi, a 36-year-old worker. She
spends 14 hours a day at work and used only
eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014, six
of which were sick leave.","About 22% of Japanese people work more
than 49 hours a week, compared with 16%
of US workers and 11% in France and
Germany, according to data from the Japanese
government. At 35%, South Korea’s workaholics
work even more.","Despite studies suggesting that longer hours in
the office or workshop or on the factory floor do
not necessarily make people more productive,
today’s workers are still nursing a collective
hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s."
"Yuu Wakebe, who works at the health ministry,
admits that he does 100 hours of overtime
a month. “It is a worker’s right to take paid
vacations,” Wakebe said. “But workers in Japan
have to do a lot of extra work for no money.”","Erika Sekiguchi spends 14 hours a day at work
and gives up many of her paid holidays. But she

"Workers are scared that their colleagues will think
they are not working hard enough. This is one
reason for a rise in stress-related illness, early
death and suicide. About 200 people die every
year from heart attacks and strokes in Japan,
caused by long hours and hard work.","Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing
policy on working hours, admits that he does
100 hours of overtime a month. He blames the
pressure to match the number of hours your
colleagues work. “It is a worker’s right to take
paid vacations,” Wakebe said. “But working in
Japan involves quite a lot of volunteer spirit.”","In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving

,"That fear of being ostracized at work is the
reason for a rise in stress-related illness,
premature death and suicide. According to official
data, about 200 people die every year from

companies across Japan: never to take time
off to recharge or to risk inviting criticism for
appearing to leave more committed colleagues in
the lurch."
,"The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is not known for
taking long vacations. But even he has said that
companies ask too much of their employees and
that working hours in Japan are too long.","Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing
policy on working hours, who admits putting
in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the

companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex
globalized market. Japan’s working culture, Abe
said recently, “falsely beatifies long hours”."
