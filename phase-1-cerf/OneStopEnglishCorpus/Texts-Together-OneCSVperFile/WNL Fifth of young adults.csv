"A fifth of young adults in the UK are staying in the
family home until they are at least 26 and a fifth are
not paying any rent. A recent survey found that the
percentage of adults who live at home was different
in different parts of the country – it was less than 9%
in the East Midlands and more than double that in
London, where house prices and rents are highest.
Many young people pay their parents some money
to live at home but 20% pay nothing at all.","Some people call it ‘the hotel of mum and dad’. A fifth
of young adults are staying in the family home until
they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not
paying a penny towards their keep. A recent survey
found that the proportion of adults living at home
varied around the country, from just under 9% in the
East Midlands to more than double that in London,
where house prices and rents are highest. While
many around the country contributed financially, it
found that 20% were paying nothing at all.","It has been called ‘the hotel of mum and dad’ but

"Young adults are suffering from low wages and
high rents. The cost of renting is too much so young
people who want to buy a house can’t save enough
to get on the property ladder. Recent research
showed half of tenants were unable to save any
money for a deposit and a quarter could only save
£100 or less each month. Mortgages are cheaper
than ever before but people who have large deposits
still get the best mortgages.","Young adults are squeezed by low wages and high
rents, while those who want to buy a property are
finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing
them from saving enough to get on the housing
ladder. Recent research showed half of tenants
were unable to save a penny towards a deposit,
while a quarter could only save £100 or less each
month. Mortgages are cheaper than ever before
thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals
are still only given to people with large deposits.","Young adults are being squeezed by low wages and

"As a result of this, more and more young adults are
returning to the family home to save money. And,
parents who cannot afford to give their children
money for a deposit seem happy to let them live at
home again. The survey found that 28% of adults
live at home because they are trying to save for a
deposit. But it also found that 30% are not saving
any money.","As a result of this, young adults are increasingly

"Michael Day, 30, who lives with his parents in
Bristol, says it’s difficult to save for a mortgage
deposit when rents are so high. Rents for a onebedroom
home in the city are between £500 and
£800 a month. Buying a similar flat would cost about
£130,000. “I don’t really want to move out to rent
because it’s more than a mortgage but you need
such a big deposit to get a mortgage.”","Michael Day, 30, who lives with his parents in

survey commented: “The hotel of mum and dad is
often staying open for longer than many anticipated,
our latest research shows. Rental costs and
deposits or the need to save for a mortgage deposit
mean that some children understandably have to
wait before flying the nest. And, for some, moving
out may never be an option.”"
"Sue Green, who works for Saga, a business that
sells insurance to people over 50, said most parents
did not think their children would live with them in
their 20s or 30s. “Most will be more than happy to
have them in the family home rent-free because
it might help their kids get on the property ladder
sooner,” she said. “Children who don’t pay rent may
pay for other things like groceries or they may do
odd jobs around the home.”","He does not want to share with strangers so his
options are limited. At home, he pays a nominal
rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of
his earnings from his job. He admits that, instead
of saving, he spends his spare money on golf and
holidays. “You need so much money that I will
have to save for the foreseeable future,” he said.

"Angus Hanton, of the Intergenerational Foundation,
said older people caused the housing crisis and
we should not blame younger people for staying at
home. “The under-30s earn, on average, 20% less
since the 2008 downturn. Rents and car insurance
have never been so high,” he said, “and many jobs
– zero-hour and short-term contracts – turn younger
workers into second-class citizens.”","Sue Green, of Saga, a business that sells insurance

"Jenna Gavin, 29, lives in the family home where
she grew up. She works as a medical receptionist
nearby so she wants to stay in the area. But renting
a one-bedroom flat would cost more than £420 a
month not including bills, which would use a lot of
her earnings. “I don’t want to rent – I don’t want
to spend all that money and have nothing at the
end,” she said. “I’ve thought about buying and seen
