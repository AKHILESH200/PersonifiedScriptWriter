"When you enter a department store, cameras are watching you. If you pick something up, a camera will make sure you don’t put it into your bag. Cameras will follow you around the store. But new technology is less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age, gender and shopping habits.","Behind the bright lights and mirrored panels, cameras are watching you. If you pick up a boot, a camerawill make sure you don’t put it into your bag. Enter a department store and you will be watched.

Pick up a boot and a camera will make sure you don’t slip it into your bag. Enter a department store and you will be watched. But new technology is leading retailers to grow a different set of eyes – less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age, sex, size, head, shoulders, knees and toes."
"A few months ago, IT company Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) wrote a report that said around 30% of stores use facial recognition technology to track customers in shops. Facial recognition is a technology that can identify people – it analyses and compares people’s faces. Shops use special cameras for this, like the Intel RealSense camera.","A few months ago, IT company Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) wrote a report that said around 30% of stores use facial recognition technologyto track customers in-store.

"Joe Jensen, who works for Intel, says that the aim of using RealSense technology in shops is not to get information about speci c people’s lives but to understand, in general, people’s lifestyles and shopping habits. “We don’t need to know a particular shopper. We need to know what characteristics this shopper has and that, when those characteristics are present, this is what a person usually does.”","Intel spokesman Joe Jensen says that the aimof using RealSense technology in shops is not to create databases of speci c people’s lives but to build generalized models of people’s lifestyles and shopping habits. “We don’t need to know a particular customer.

It’s thatyou need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and, in the past, that when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.”"
"This technology makes it possible to predict what a person may or may not do in a shop. If, for example, a woman is walking quickly towards the sock section, a store can automatically put ads on screens speci cally for that person. If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks.","If you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns, you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop. If, for example, there’s a woman walking quickly towards the sock section, you can use that data to predict she wants to buy socks. That could allow a store to automatically put targetedads on screens aimed speci cally at that person. If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks.","If you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns, you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop. If, say, there’s a size-10 woman wearing a gold necklace walking quickly towards the sock aisle, you can use that data to predict she wants to, well, buy socks. That could allow a retailer to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person. If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks."
"If it sounds familiar, it’s because the internet has been using techniques like these for years. If you search for something on Amazon, you’ll get ads for similar products on other sites. But it’s not easy to use these systems in shops. People do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to cookies on websites.","If it sounds familiar, it’s because the online world has been using techniques like these for years.

If you search for something on Amazon, you’ll be hounded by targeted banners for similar products on other sites. Express a vague interest in canoeing and you’ll get ads for canoes wherever you go. Yet bringing these systems into the physical world isn’t a simple case of copy and paste. It turns out that people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do tobrowser cookies."
"One company, Hoxton Analytics, has developed a technology that puts people into categories based on the shoes they are wearing. By analysing the style and size of people’s shoes, the system can identify a customer’s gender with 75-80% accuracy.","Hoxton Analytics, a team of data scientists in London, has developed a technology that uses machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing.

By analysing the style and size of people’s footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customer’s gender with between 75 and 80% accuracy."
"Owen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, says that they wanted the system to be different from facial recognition. “I thought, why don’t we simply look at the clothes someone’s wearing?” he said. “If I just showed you a photo of someone’s body, you could probably tell me what gender they are. But pointing a camera at someone’s body feels just as creepy as facial recognition. The idea was – what about people’s shoes?”","Owen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, saysthat the focus of the system was partly a reactionto facial recognition. “My idea was, why don’t we simply consider the clothes someone’s wearing?”he said. “If I just showed you a photo of someone’s body, you could probably tell me what gender they are. However, pointing a camera at someone’s chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition.

People use the word “creepy” a lot during discussions of tracking in stores. Stores need to  nd a way of getting information without seeming intrusive.,"People use the word “creepy” a lot during discussions of in-store tracking. For stores and data scientists, the aim is to  nd a way of getting information without seeming intrusive.","The word “creepy” comes up a lot during discussions of in-store tracking. For retailers and data scientists, the aim is to  nd a way of obtaining information without coming across as intrusive."
"McCormack says, “Right now, shops are doing lots of intrusive things but we just don’t know about it. We tell the shops that, if you know someone’s a male or a female, your advertising will work better. If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, you’ll advertise PlayStations not hairdryers.”","For McCormack, the argument is based on the fact that personal information isn’t collected. “Right now, shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just don’t know about it. What we say is that, if you know someone’s a male or a female, then your advertising will be much more ef cient. If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, you’ll be advertising PlayStations not hairdryers.”","For Hoxton Analytics and the retailers using the technology, the answer is to look downwards. This tactic of avoiding the face and staring at shoes says a lot about how we, as physical beings, react to being watched. It suggests there are boundaries that do not exist on the internet. Set sights on our torsos and we feel invaded. But is making calculated judgments about a person based on their footwear actually anyless invasive?"
"It is easy to understand that stores wantsome of the information online stores collect. We allow this to happen online so why not in shops? But shopping centres are different from websites – you walk from one shop to another without a computer asking you if it’s ok to collect information about you.","From the perspective of stores, it’s understandable that physical shops want some of the information online shops collect. We allow this to happen online so why not of ine? Online, you get a pop-up asking you to accept cookies. But you can’t ask for people’s consent in the same way when they move from one physical shop to another.","For McCormack, the argument hinges on the fact that personally identi able information isn’t being collected. “Right now, shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just don’t know about it. The angle Hoxton Analytics is taking on that whole thing is, well, if you know someone’s a male or a female, then your advertising will be much more ef cient. If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, you’ll beadvertising PlayStations not hairdryers.”"
"But young people who are growing up withonline shopping do not think online advertisingis invasive. In the CSC report, a survey showed that 72% of people aged 55 or more said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies in real shops. But only 51% of 16-24 year olds said they were uncomfortable. In any case, there are more and more eyes watching you and they care a lot about what you’re wearing.","But it’s also true that the generation that is growing up with online shopping does not see online advertising as so invasive. In the CSC report, a survey showed that 72% of people aged 55 or more said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies in physical shops. But only 51% of 16-24 year olds said they were uncomfortable.","Keep it hidden and invisible monitoring lets shops optimize their output while keeping the customer unaware. Put adaptable monitors and targeted advertising into the mix, however, and it becomes harder to hide the fact that a machine is watching you. The argument from the retailers is that they do this to provide a personal shopping experience but it remains a grey area. It still feels creepy."
,"Are younger people more open because they are more familiar with digital technology or do they believe in the honesty of organizations offering free services? Is this kind of technology always creepy or does it depend? In any case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what you’re wearing.","From the perspective of retailers, it’s understandable that physical shops want someof the information online outlets collect. We allow this to happen online so why not of ine? The thresholds of a shopping centre are differentfrom those between websites and, when you can wander freely from one place to another without a pop-up asking you to accept cookies, the rules of consent change."
,,"Then again, for a generation growing up with online  rst, physical shop second, the modesof online play may not be quite so invasive. In the CSC report, a survey indicated that while 72% of respondents aged 55 and over said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies being used in physical shops, only 51% of 16-24 year olds said the same."
,,"Does this relative openness stem from a greater familiarity with digital technology or a blind belief in the goodwill of omnipresent organizations offering free services? Is the creepiness of a technology an unvarying, instinctive certaintyor does it ebb and  ow with degrees of social acceptance? Whatever the case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what you’re wearing."
