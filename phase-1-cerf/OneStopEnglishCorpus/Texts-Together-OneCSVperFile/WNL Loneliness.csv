"People are talking a lot about loneliness at the
moment. The Office for National Statistics says
that Britain is the loneliest place in Europe. British
people have fewer strong friendships than other
Europeans and they know their neighbours less
well. Research at the University of Chicago has
found that loneliness is twice as bad for older
people’s health as obesity. They also found that
loneliness causes almost as many deaths
as poverty.","Loneliness has finally become a hot topic. The

"This is shocking but these studies do not talk
about loneliness in younger adults. In 2010, a
Mental Health Foundation survey found that
loneliness was a bigger worry for young people
than for the elderly. The 18- to 34-year-olds in the
survey felt lonely more often, worried more about
feeling alone and felt more depressed because of
loneliness than people over 55.","This is shocking but such studies do not examine

"“We know that loneliness is a problem for the
elderly and there are day centres and charities
to help them,” says Sam Challis, of the mental
health charity Mind, “but, young people over 21
are too old for youth services.” This is not good
because loneliness can cause mental health
problems – loneliness causes stress, depression,
paranoia, anxiety, addiction and it can
cause suicide.","“Loneliness is a recognized problem among the
elderly and there are day centres and charities

between loneliness and mental health – it is

essay, Paul Farmer, the chief executive of Mind,

Mental Health Foundation, say it can be both a
cause and effect of mental health problems."
"But what can young people do to prevent
loneliness? One researcher says that social
media and the internet can be both a good thing
and a problem. They are a good thing when they
allow us to communicate with friends and family
far away but not when they replace face-to-face
contact. “People present ‘perfect’ versions of
themselves online and we expect to have social
lives like the lives we see in the media,” says
Challis. If we compare the ‘perfect’ lives of our
friends with our own lives, this can make us want
to stay at home alone.","But what can young people do to prevent

Institute points out that social media and the

"A study of social media at the University of
Michigan in 2013 found that using technology to
help you meet new people can be a good thing.
And, if you can’t go out, the internet can help you.
For example, Mumsnet, an online network for
parents, can help you feel less alone when you
are at home with young children.","Meditation techniques and apps such as
Headspace are trendy solutions frequently
recommended for a range of mental health
problems, but they’re not necessarily helpful for
loneliness, as they actively encourage us to be
alone with our thoughts. “It is better to address
the causes of your loneliness first – what’s
stopping you going out and seeing people?”
says Challis.","While meditation techniques and apps such

"Helplines can also reduce loneliness, at least
in the short term. One in four of men who call
the emotional support charity Samaritans say
they are lonely. Get Connected is a free helpline
for young people, where they can get help with
emotional and mental health problems caused
by loneliness.","Indeed, a study of social media at the University

reduces life satisfaction, using technology to help

has been “an absolute godsend” for Maddy
Matthews, 19, a student with a two-month-old
daughter. Since the birth, she rarely sees her
university friends and her partner works most
evenings. “In the first few days, I was up late at
night feeding her and I was worried I was doing
something wrong. Being able to post on Mumsnet
has helped me feel less alone.”"
"At work, it can be a good idea to tell your
employer how you’re feeling. Talking to your
colleagues may seem like a waste of time but
it can help to protect us from the emotional and
psychological problems caused by working
too hard.","Helplines can also reduce loneliness, at least
in the short term. One in four men who call the
emotional support charity Samaritans mention

"According to recent research, loneliness is killing
the elderly and, with an ageing population, we
should try to reduce our isolation before it is
too late. “Getting older doesn’t have to mean
getting lonelier,” says Ruth Sutherland, the chief
executive of the relationship counselling service
Relate. “But it is very important to create goodquality
relationships earlier in life.”","At work, it can be beneficial to tell your employer
how you’re feeling. John Binns advises
businesses on mental health and well-being.
He was admitted to hospital for stress-related
depression in 2007 and took two months off
work. He felt as if there was no one to talk to
and wasn’t close enough to colleagues for them
to notice the changes in his behaviour. More
openness with his employer and colleagues
made his return to work easier. Office chit-chat
may seem like a waste of time but it helps to
protect us from the emotional and psychological
effects of work strain.","At work, it can be beneficial to tell your employer

but they’re fundamental to our well-being,”
says Nicky Forsythe, a psychotherapist and
