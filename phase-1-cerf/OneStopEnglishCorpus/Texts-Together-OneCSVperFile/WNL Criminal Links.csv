"Police have been worried about €500 notes for a
long time. Small and easy to transport, they are
the favourite banknotes of criminals. The sum of
€1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop
bag. The same amount in €50 notes would need
a small suitcase.","Law enforcement officials have been worried

"The UK stopped using the €500 note in 2010
because they were used “almost entirely by
criminals”. In 2009, Italy’s central bank said that
mafia money launderers and terrorists used the

"These days, we have electronic payment
systems and contactless cards so people are
asking why it is still necessary to have these
banknotes. Peter Sands, the former head of
Standard Chartered Bank, said we should get
rid of large notes, including the €500, the $100,
the 1,000 Swiss Franc note and the £50. Sands
said it was time to get rid of high-value notes
that make life easier for “bad guys”. Criminals
would instead use smaller banknotes, or gold or
diamonds, but these are big so criminals cannot
carry them easily”, he said.","Now, with electronic payment systems and

"The purple €500 note was introduced in 2002:
it replaced the 1,000 Deutschmark, the 10,000
Belgian franc and the 500,000 Italian lira. In
Germany and Austria, people still pay with paper
money and coins more than half the time.","At a conference on terrorist financing in London,
the Head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, asked
the European Central Bank to look at whether
it “should continue to produce these notes that
make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide
their business and to provide money for illegal
activities”. According to Europol, the purple €500
note makes up 30% of the value of all the euro
notes, although most people have never seen one.","At a conference on terrorist financing in London,

"Europol would like central banks to take more
responsibility for what happens with €500 notes.

authorities to look at whether countries should
limit high-value notes or get rid of them.","The €500 note was introduced in 2002 when

euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 Deutschmark,
the 10,000 Belgian franc and the 500,000 Italian
lira. Several European countries favoured highvalue
banknotes. “It is definitely a preference that
has been there for a long time,” says Pia Hüttl,
an affiliate fellow at the Bruegel thinktank. “The
preference is based on the idea that cash has a
lower cost and is accepted everywhere.”"
,"Europol would like to see central banks take
more responsibility for what happens with €500
notes. Luxembourg, for example, issued more
than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013
alone. Europol asked Luxembourg’s central bank
to explain. The reply from Luxembourg was that
they simply issue the notes that are asked for
and do not ask or know why people want them,
said Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in Europol’s
financial intelligence group. “I find it surprising that
a central bank does not consider itself to have a
responsibility in this area.”","Cash remains king in Germany and Austria, where
more than half of all transactions are made with
paper money and coins. The former president
of Germany’s constitutional court, Hans-Jürgen
Papier, told Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with
individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper Bild
has launched a petition in defence of paper money,
including the €500 note – “hands off my cash”."
,"This could be changing. EU finance ministers
have asked policymakers to think about
“appropriate limits” on high-value notes and report
back by 1 May 2016.","Law enforcement authorities are less convinced,
amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious
bundles of cash. In one case that has caught
the attention of police, two men walked into a
bank and tried to deposit €200,000 of torn and
muddy €500 notes. In the same week, €1.3m in €500 notes was found stuffed in the false bottom
of suitcase. But, a suspicion of criminality is not
enough to keep people in custody. “Our frustration
from a law enforcement perspective is that, in
many jurisdictions, it is impossible to provide
sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities
of a link between suspicious cash detections and
criminality,” says Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in
Europol’s financial intelligence group. “The search
for these links is complicated further through
time constraints and fragmented cooperation and
information exchange.”"
,,"The agency would like to see central banks take
more responsibility for the “striking anomalies”
in the use of €500 notes. Luxembourg, for
example, issued more than twice its annual GDP
in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one
of the most cash-averse countries in Europe.
Europol asked Luxembourg’s central bank to

that they simply issue the notes requested and
have no explanation for the reasons behind the
demand,” MacLeod says. “I find it surprising that
a central bank does not consider itself to have a
responsibility in this area.”"
,,"This could be changing. Mario Draghi, the head of
the ECB, has said he is determined that the income
the bank generates from issuing the notes should
not be “a comfort for criminals”. Other members of
the ECB’s top team, such as Yves Mersch, contend
there is no evidence about the criminal uses of
the €500 note. But, amid heightened fears about
terrorism, this argument may no longer cut any ice.
EU finance ministers have called on policymakers
to explore “appropriate restrictions” on high-value
notes and report back by 1 May 2016."
