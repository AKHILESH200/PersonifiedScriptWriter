engineer and industrialist called Sam Eyde. The
great man stares northwards across the square
at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him."
"Behind him, to the south, is the 1,800-metre
mountain known as Gaustatoppen. Between the
mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, is
the small town that Eyde built at the beginning of
the last century for his factory workers.","Behind him, to the south, rises the 1,800-metre

"But one thing he couldn’t do was change the sun.
Deep in its east–west valley, with high mountains
all around, Rjukan and the 3,400 people who
live there are in shadow for half the year. In the
daytime, from late September to mid-March,
the town, three hours north-west of Oslo, is not
completely dark, but it’s certainly not bright.","But one thing he couldn’t do was change the sun.

"Now, high on the mountain opposite Eyde’s
statue, 450 metres above the town, three large,
solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors follow
the movement of the sun across the sky. They
reflect the sunshine down on to the square and fill
it in bright sunlight.","Now, high on the mountain opposite Eyde’s

out upon a sight that even he might have found

"Two young mothers bring their children into the

"Andersen had the idea for an artwork he calls the
Solspeil, or Sun mirror, at the end of September
one year: “Every day, we took our young child for
a walk,” he says, “and, every day, I realized we
had to go a little further down the valley to find
the sun.” By 28 September, the sun completely
disappears from Rjukan’s market square. It
doesn’t reappear until 12 March.","The idea of an artwork Andersen called the

of town.”","In the months between September and March,
