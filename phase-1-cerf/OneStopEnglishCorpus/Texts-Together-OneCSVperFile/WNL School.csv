"One in ten children are obese when theystart school at the age of four or  ve, say the Health & Social Care Information Centre.

"“Running is a good way to improve children’s  tness, and it’s free and easy. The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it. If they didn’t enjoy it, you couldn’t continue with it.They come back inside with bright eyes and rosy cheeks. It’s how children used to look,” said Wyllie. At St Ninian’s, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to the school’s playing  eld for their daily mile at a time that suits that day’s timetable. Only ice or very heavy rain stop them.","“It’s a common-sense approach to children’s  tness, which is free and easy.

"Researchers from Stirling University have begun a study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile. Dr Colin Moran, who is leading the study, said: “The children don’t seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and teachers say they learn better. So we designed a study that testsall of these things.” They will compare St Ninian’s pupils with children from another school in Stirling where children haven’t started running yet.","The extent of the bene ts isn’t known yetbut researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile.
