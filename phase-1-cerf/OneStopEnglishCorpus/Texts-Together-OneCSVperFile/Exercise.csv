"Imagine that you read a headline ‘Fit in four
minutes’ in a health magazine. Would you
believe it? Well, Dr Izumi Tabata’s training
programme – 20 seconds of intensive effort, ten
seconds of rest, repeat eight times – promises
that it is possible to be fit with just 88 minutes of
training a week.","‘Fit in four minutes’ sounds like a headline from
a health magazine or an impossible promise

– and, after collapsing on the floor, you realize
you were wrong.","Fit in four minutes. It sounds like a headline from

and between sounding like Darth Vader as you
desperately suck in oxygen and collapsing in a
messy bundle of sweat and defeat, you realize
just how wrong you were."
"Tabata remembers the first time he tested his
training system on his university students in the
early 1990s. “After four minutes’ hard exercise they
were completely exhausted. They were almost
dead! But after six weeks they saw the results and
were surprised. We all were surprised.”","Tabata has seen it all before. “They were dead!”
he laughs as he remembers the first time he
tried out his system on his university students
in the early 1990s. “After four minutes’ hard
exercise they were completely exhausted. But
after six weeks they saw the results and were
surprised. We all were.”","Tabata has seen it all before. “They were dead!”
he chuckles as he recalls the first time he inflicted
the system that bears his name on his university
students in the early 1990s. “After four minutes’
hard exercise they were wiped out. But after six
weeks they saw the results and were surprised.
We all were.”"
"Tabata created his training programme after he
watched Japan’s speed skating team in the early
1990s. He saw that short bursts of very hard
exercise were as effective as hours of normal
exercise. Tabata tried to prove this with a simple
experiment. One group of students did an hour
of cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike
five times a week. The other group did a
ten-minute warm-up on the bike, then four
minutes of Tabata training, four times a week –
plus one 30-minute session of exercise with two
minutes of Tabata.","He began his research after he watched Japan’s
speed skating team in the early 1990s – he
noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard
exercise seemed to be at least as effective
as hours of moderate training. Tabata tried to
prove this with a simple experiment. One group
of moderately trained students did an hour of
steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise
bike five times a week. The other group did a
ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four
minutes of Tabata training, four times a week –
plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise
with two minutes of Tabata.","His research followed extensive monitoring of
Japan’s speed skating team in the early 1990s
when he – along with the team’s coach Irisawa
Koichi – noticed that short bursts of brutally hard
exercise seemed to be at least as effective as
hours of moderate training. Tabata set out to
show this with a simple experiment. One group of
moderately trained students performed an hour
of steady cardiovascular exercise on a stationary
bike five times a week. The other group did a
ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four
minutes of Tabata intervals, four times a week –
plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise
with two minutes of intervals."
"The results were very surprising. After six weeks
of testing, the group who did Tabata’s plan –
exercising for just 88 minutes a week –
increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and
their VO2 max by 15%. The other group, who
trained for five hours every week, also
improved their VO2 max, but only by 10%.
But their training had no effect on their
anaerobic capacity.","The results were very surprising. After six
weeks of testing, the group following Tabata’s

cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic
power, by 15%. The control group, who trained
for five hours every week, also improved their
VO2 max, but by 10% – and their training had no
effect on anaerobic capacity.”We also measured
increases in heart size after three weeks of
doing the exercises,” says Tabata","The results were startling. After six weeks of

– and their training had no effect on anaerobic
capacity. “We have also measured increases in
heart size after three weeks of doing the protocol,”
says Tabata. “And there is also forthcoming
research that shows that it lowers the risk of
diabetes in humans, something we have already
shown in rats.”"
"But you have to work very, very hard. You can’t
sit on a machine, chewing gum and reading
HELLO! magazine. You have to do intensive
bursts of activity on an exercise bike or rowing
machine, explosive bodyweight exercises,
sprints and so on. Remember how you felt after
doing a 100m sprint at school? Imagine doing
eight sprints with only a ten-second break
between them.","But you have to work very, very hard. You can’t

"“Full effort at 170% of your VO2 max is the basis
of the programme,” says Tabata. “If you feel OK
afterwards you’ve not done it properly. The first
three repetitions will feel easy but the last two
will feel impossible. In the original plan, we
wanted eight repetitions, but some people could
only do six or seven.”","“All-out effort at 170% of your VO2 max is the
basis of the programme,” says Tabata. “If you

last two will feel impossibly hard. In the original
plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only
managed six or seven.”","“All-out effort at 170% of your VO2 max is the

aim was to get to eight, but some only lasted six
or seven.”"
"One person on an online forum wrote: “Most
people cannot do it correctly and they shouldn’t
even try.” Tabata doesn’t completely agree.
“Everyone can do it but beginners should start
with educated trainers so that they don’t work
too hard,” he explains. He also says that his
programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12
hours after exercise. Most people use it to get fit
or to get even fitter, but the programme also
burns fat.","One person on an online forum wrote: “When
done correctly you should meet God. Most
people are incapable of doing it correctly and

at the correct intensity for them,” he explains.
He adds that his programme burns an extra 150
calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at
rest. So, although it is used by most people to
get fit – or by fit people to get even fitter – it also
burns fat.","As one commenter on the popular exercise forum
T-Nation puts it: “When done correctly you should
meet God. Most people are incapable of doing it
correctly and shouldn’t even try.”"
"So, it’s a little surprising that at the moment only
serious athletes are doing the programme. This
may change because Tabata says there will soon
be Tabata instructors and a series of DVDs at the
end of the year. “I decided to do this because I
often go on YouTube and some people are doing
it wrong because they don’t understand how hard
they need to work,” says Tabata.","It’s slightly surprising, therefore, that only
serious athletes follow the programme at the
moment. But that may change now that Tabata
has agreed a deal that will lead to a network of
instructors and a DVD range released towards
the end of the year. “I decided to do this because
I often go on YouTube and, while I am pleased
that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong
because they don’t realize how hard they need

do it but beginners should start with educated
trainers so that they can work at the correct
intensity for them,” he explains. He says that he
will soon publish research showing that doing
the programme just twice a week, less than half
the volume in the original research, still provides
significant health benefits."
"So, should we all start using Tabata in our fitness
programmes? Richard Scrivener, a former rugby
fitness coach, says that you should not stop your
usual training; Tabata training is something extra.
“Runners, for example, need to run a lot of miles
in their training,” he says. “But they could do
fewer long runs by introducing Tabata training.
This will give their bodies the chance to rest and
recover, especially if they have injuries.”","So should we all start following this plan?
Richard Scrivener, a former rugby fitness coach,
says that while the benefits are clear, Tabatas
are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured
sport or training method. “Runners, for instance,
need a high level of running economy, which
comes from learning the skills and running for
many miles,” says Scrivener, “But they could
reduce the number of long runs and the overall
mileage by introducing Tabata training. This will give joints the chance to rest and recover,
especially if you have a history of injuries – and
you would probably therefore get more benefit
from the long runs when you do them.”","Another soon-to-be-published finding, which
Tabata describes as “rather significant”, shows
that the Tabata protocol burns an extra 150
calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at
rest, due to the effect of excess post-exercise
oxygen consumption. So while it is used by most
people to get fit – or by fit people to get even fitter
– it also burns fat."
"Gym fans can benefit by doing three strength
sessions and three Tabatas a week. And the rest
of us can slowly increase the number of
sessions, but we know that it will never get
easier because every session needs maximum
effort. That’s the programme: it is hard – but
it works.","Gym rats can benefit by doing three strength
sessions and three Tabatas a week. And the

it is hard – and effective.","It’s slightly surprising, therefore, that the plan
is still the preserve of the serious athlete and
musclehead crowd – although that may change

Studios that will lead to a network of instructors

year. “I decided to do this because I often go on
