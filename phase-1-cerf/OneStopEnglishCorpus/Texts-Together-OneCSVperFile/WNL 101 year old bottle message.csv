"Angela Erdmann never knew her grandfather.
He died in 1946, six years before she was born.
But, on Tuesday April 8th, 2014, she described
the extraordinary moment when she received a
message in a bottle, 101 years after he threw
it into the Baltic Sea. The bottle is possibly
the world’s oldest message in a bottle. It was
presented to Erdmann by the museum that is
now exhibiting it in Germany.","Angela Erdmann never knew her grandfather.

"“It was very surprising,” Erdmann, 62, said,
when she described how she found out about
the bottle. “A man came to my door and told me
he had post from my grandfather. Then, he told
me that someone had found a message in a
bottle and that on the card was my grandfather’s
name.” Her visitor was a family-tree researcher
who found her in Berlin after someone gave the
letter to a museum in the northern city
of Hamburg.","“It was very surprising,” Erdmann, 62, said,

"The brown beer bottle was in the water for 101
years. A fisherman found it. Holger von Neuhoff,
a curator at the museum, said this bottled
message was the oldest he had ever seen.
“There are documents without the bottle that are
older and they are in the museum,” he said. “But,
with the bottle and the document, this is certainly
the oldest at the moment. It is in very
good condition.”","The brown beer bottle, which had been in the

"Researchers believe that Erdmann’s grandfather,
Richard Platz, threw the bottle into the sea when
he was on a hike in 1913. He was 20 years old
at the time. A lot of the message on the postcard
was impossible to read, but the address in Berlin
on the front of the card was legible. Platz asked
the person who found it to send the postcard to
his home address.","Researchers believe Erdmann’s grandfather,

were also in the bottle, so the finder would not
have to pay for postage,” Erdmann said. “But he
did not think it would take 101 years.”","“He also included two stamps from that time that

found out that he was a writer. He was very openminded,
and he believed in freedom and that
everyone should respect each other,” she said.

because I could see where my roots came from.”","“I knew very little about my grandfather, but I

"The message and the bottle will be on display at

of May 2014. Then, experts will try to decipher
the rest of the text. It is not clear what will happen
to the bottle after that, but Erdmann hopes it will
stay at the museum.","The message and the bottle will be on display at
