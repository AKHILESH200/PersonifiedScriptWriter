"BB King was most famous for blues music but he was always interested in other types of music and different cultures. Perhaps it is too early to sayhe is “the last of the bluesmen” but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will have the in uence as BB King. He in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years.","Much of BB King’s best work was blues but he was always open-minded about and interested in other kinds of music. He bridged musicaland cultural differences with warmth and skill. Perhaps it is too early to speak of “the last of the bluesmen” but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will match King. He in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years.","Although much of his work, and arguably nearly all the best of it, was  rmly within the disciplineof the blues, BB King was always open-minded and interested when he found himself in other settings, bridging musical and cultural differences with affability and skill. Perhaps it is premature to speak of “the last of the bluesmen” but it is hard to imagine any future blues artist matching King’s in uence over musicians by the thousand and audiences by the million in a career spanning65 years."
"Riley B King was born in Mississippi, the son of African-American farm workers. He learnt the guitar from a family friend and learnt to sing with a quartet of gospel singers. In his early 20s, he moved to Memphis.","Riley B King (the B did not seem to stand for a name) was born in Mississippi, the son of African-American farm workers.

In his early 20s, he moved to Memphis."
"He was soon playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis and he also became a disc jockey, with a show on a local radio station. He was known as “The Beale Street Blues Boy” but this was shortened to “Blues Boy King” and then to “BB”. In 1950, King began recording forModern Records.","Within a couple of years, he was playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis and he also becamea disc jockey, presenting a show on a Memphis radio station.

"He had his  rst hit in 1952 with Three O’Clock Blues. It was number one in the R&B chart for 15 weeks; it was the  rst of many hits. King developed a style that was new and different but had its roots in blues history. He often praised the musicians who in uenced him and he usually mentioned T-Bone Walker  rst. He also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian andDjango Reinhardt.","He had his  rst hit in 1952, with Three O’Clock Blues, which was number one in the R&B chart for 15 weeks; it was the  rst of many hits.

On these and his dozens of other recordings, most of them his own compositions, King developed a style that was both innovative and rooted in blues history. He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him and would usually mention T-Bone Walker first."
"He once explained that his guitar techniquewas partly the result of his lack of skill: “I started to bend notes because I could never play inthe bottleneck style. I loved that sound but just couldn’t do it.” During the 1950s, King was the leading blues artist in many series of concerts. In 1956, he played 342 concerts. In 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, ABC. But the  rst records under that contract were not very successful with his fans or with the record company. ","He once explained that his guitar techniquewas partly based on his lack of skill: “I startedto bend notes because I could never play inthe bottleneck style. I loved that sound but just couldn’t do it.” He was modest about his singing, too, a mixture of the style of ballad singers such as Nat King Cole and blues shouters such as Joe Turner and Dr Clayton. Probably his favourite composer and singer was Louis Jordan, whose music he commemorated in the 1999 album Let the Good Times Roll.","“I’ve tried my best to get that sound,” he told the Guitar Player magazine. “I came pretty close but never quite got it.” In an interview in 2001, he said: “If T-Bone Walker had been a woman I would have asked him to marry me.” But he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian andDjango Reinhardt."
"But his 1965 album, Live at the Regal, has become famous and in uenced many younger musicians. He had more R&B hits with blues songs and, in 1969, he was near the top of the pop charts – where no blues artist had been for many years – with a song called The ThrillIs Gone.","Throughout the 1950s, King was the leading blues artist on an endless series of one-nighters. In 1956, he played 342 gigs. In 1962, he triedto change that working pattern by signing with a major label, ABC, but the  rst records under that contract were rather unsuccessful, both with his fans and with the record company.","He once explained that his guitar techniquewas partly based on his lack of skill: “I startedto bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style, like Elmore James and Booker White. I loved that sound but just couldn’t doit.” He was similarly self-deprecating about his singing, a sumptuous blend of honey and lemon, mixed half-and-half from crooners such as Nat King Cole and blues shouters such as Joe Turner and Dr Clayton. Probably his favourite composer and singer was Louis Jordan, whose music he commemorated in the 1999 album Let the Good Times Roll."
"It was a long time before he became known to a rock audience but musicians who admired him brought him to the attention of rock fans. “About a year and a half ago,” he said in 1969, “kids suddenly started saying to me, ‘You’rethe greatest blues guitarist in the world.’ AndI’d say, ‘Who told you that?’ And they’d say, ‘Mike Bloom eld’ or ‘Eric Clapton’. These young musicians made me popular again.”","The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however,has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians. He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he got near the top of the pop charts – where no blues artist had been for many years – with The Thrill Is Gone.","Throughout the 1950s, King was the leading blues artist on the circuit of black-patronized theatres and clubs on an interminable series of one-nighters. In 1956, he is supposed to have  lled 342 engagements. In 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, ABC, but the  rst records underthat contract, which tried to reshape him as a mainstream pop singer, were as unsatisfactory to his admirers as they were to ABC’s accountants."
"From then on, King was well known as a leading blues artist. He went on international concert tours to Japan, Australia, China and Russia. He also gave concerts to prisoners in Chicago and at San Quentin.","It took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him. “About a year and a half ago,” he said in 1969, “all of a sudden, kids started saying to me, ‘You’re the greatest blues guitarist in the world.’ And I’d say, ‘Who told you that?’ And they’d say, ‘Mike Bloom eld’ or ‘Eric Clapton’.

"In 1990, doctors told King he had diabetes and he reduced his touring. He now had to play sitting down but his singing and playing were almostas good as ever. The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album with Clapton, Mark Knop er, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a “goodbye tour” that was not a goodbye at all.","From then on, King was  rmly established asa leading blues artist. Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he went on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia. He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin, which led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes.","It took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience, for whom the blues was largely de ned by the Chicago school of Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him. “About a year and a half ago,” he said in 1969, “all ofa sudden, kids started coming up to me saying, ‘You’re the greatest blues guitarist in the world.’ And I’d say, ‘Who told you that?’ And they’d say, ‘Mike Bloom eld’ or ‘Eric Clapton’. It’s to these youngsters that I owe my new popularity.” He acquired further rock credibility with the 1970 album Indianola Mississippi Seeds, on which hecollaborated with Carole King and Joe Walsh."
"In 2009, King received a Grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for One Kind Favor. In 2012, he performed at a concert at the White House, where the US President, Barack Obama, joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago. King was twice married and twice divorced. He is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others died before him.","In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but his followers outside the US could still see him every year or two.
