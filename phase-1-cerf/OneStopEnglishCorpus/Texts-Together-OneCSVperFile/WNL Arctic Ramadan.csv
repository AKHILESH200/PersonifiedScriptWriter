"In summer, in the Arctic regions of Canada, the
sun shines for more than 20 hours a day. Some
people enjoy this after the constant darkness of
winter. But, for the small Muslim community of
Iqaluit, life in the land of the midnight sun is a real
challenge during the month of Ramadan, when
Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.","In the Arctic regions of Canada, the summer

"“I haven’t fainted once,” said 29-year-old Abdul
Karim, one of only a few Muslims in the area
who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the
Arctic sun. This year, that means he eats at about
1.30am before the sun rises and breaks his fast
at about 11pm when the sun sets. “I would only
stop if it hurt my health,” Karim said.","“I haven’t fainted once,” said 29-year-old Abdul

"Most Muslims in Iqaluit follow the timetable that
Muslims in Ottawa, about 1,300 miles south,
follow. This follows the advice of Muslim scholars
who have said Muslims in the far north should
observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca
or the nearest Muslim city. They still have to fast
for around 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who
moved to Iqaluit from Toronto. “The days are
long, but we can do it.”","It is nearly the end of Ramadan for Muslims
around the world. Fasting is important but, during
the holy month, in every Muslim community, there
is also a focus on community work, prayer and
reflection. But, in Iqaluit and the other Muslim
communities in the Arctic, the long days have
forced a change in how they fast.","As the end of Ramadan draws near for Muslims
around the world, much of the holy month’s

forced a shift in how the element of fasting is
approached."
"It’s a similar situation in all of Canada’s most
northern mosques during Ramadan, where
Muslims have to live with very long or very short
days. In recent years, much of the community
has chosen to follow the Ramadan timetable of
Edmonton, in Alberta. Some follow the timetable
of Mecca, for example Awan, a father of two
young children, including a 12-year-old who
recently started fasting. He hopes that the easier
timetable will encourage his son – it means
about 15 hours of fasting, not 18 hours like in
Edmonton. “If I fast Edmonton times, my son
might say, ‘Papa, you are really insane. What are
you doing?’” he said.","Most Muslims in Iqaluit follow the timetable

"For the 100 Muslims in Inuvik, a small town 125
miles north of the Arctic Circle, it is impossible to
follow the local movements of the sun. They also
follow Edmonton’s timetable. “We currently have
24 hours a day of sun,” said Ahmad Alkhalaf.
“There’s no sunrise or sunset.” People already
followed the Edmonton timetable in 2001 when
he moved from Toronto to the small northern
town of 3,500 people. “My first Ramadan here
was in December. There’s no sun at that time; it’s
dark all day and night. So we used
Edmonton time.”","Many in the community of 100 people break their
fast together – they gather in the city’s brand new
mosque for nightly suppers. As they tuck into
traditional food such as dates and goat or lamb
curries, the sun shines brightly through
the windows.","Many in the 100-strong community break their
fast together, gathering in the city’s brand
new mosque – completed in February amid
temperatures that dropped as low as -50C with
wind chill – for nightly suppers. As they tuck into
traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb
curries, the sun shines brightly through
the windows."
"Sometimes, it can be difficult to follow the clock
and not the sun, Alkhalaf said. “We should break
our fast when it’s dusk but we eat when the sun
is up. It’s not usual to have iftar [the meal that
breaks the fast] when the sun is up,” he said.","It’s a similar situation across Canada’s most
northern mosques during Ramadan, as Muslims
deal with the country’s unique geography. In
recent years, much of the community has chosen

in Alberta. Some follow the timings of Mecca, for
example Awan, a father of two young children,
including a 12-year-old who recently started

the more manageable timetable of about 15
hours of fasting compared with about 18 hours
in Edmonton. “If I fast Edmonton times, my son

you doing?’” he said.","It’s a scene that plays out across Canada’s
northernmost mosques during Ramadan, as
Muslim communities wrestle with the country’s
unique geography. The 300 or so Muslims in
Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, have
several options when it comes to fasting during
Ramadan, said Nazim Awan, president of the
Yellowknife Islamic Centre, with exceptions made
for those who are pregnant or ill. “There might
be some superhumans who want to fast for 23
hours, but the other option is to follow the intent
and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or
they can follow the times of Mecca and Medina.”"
"In Inuvik, where most of the population is Inuit,
the Muslim community has tried to find a balance
between Ramadan and the local culture and
traditions. The iftar meal includes curries and also
local meat such as reindeer. “We make a soup or
curry, but we don’t use beef, we use reindeer.”","For the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik, a small

"In Iqaluit, this Ramadan has been one of the
most difficult of recent years because it includes
some of the longest days of the year. It’s
particularly true for people like Karim who have
followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully.
But, it will be easier for him to fast in future years,
he says, thanks to the lunar calendar. Ramadan
will then fall during winter and, in Iqaluit, the sun
will rise and set within a few hours each day. “I’ll
follow those hours, too,” he said with a laugh.
“Oh yes!”","They were already following the Edmonton
