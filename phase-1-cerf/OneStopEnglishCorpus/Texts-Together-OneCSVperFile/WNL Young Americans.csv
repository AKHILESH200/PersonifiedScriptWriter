"McDonald’s is the world’s biggest burger chain and a symbol of American consumer capitalism. But, these days, the golden arches of McDonald’s are not looking so golden. The company has got much bigger since 2003 but, now, the numbersof customers are falling. McDonald’s says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 3.3%.","McDonald’s is the world’s biggest burger chain and a global emblem of American consumer capitalism. But, these days, the golden arches of McDonald’s are looking a little tarnished. After a decade of expansion, customers around the world don’t seem to be ‘lovin’ it’ any more. McDonald’s has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% from 2013. The set of results were described as awful."," It is not just the world’s biggest burger chain; it is also a global emblem of American consumer capitalism.

"The company has problems almost everywhere. In China, sales fell by 23%. In Europe, sales fell by 4%, mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the anti-western mood in Russia. Health inspectors have investigated around 200 of McDonald’s 450 restaurants in Russia and they have closed ten restaurants.","The company has problems almost everywhere. In China, sales fell by 23% because local media showed workers at a local supplier claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in McDonald’s and KFC products.

Around 200 of McDonald’s 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors and ten have been closed.","Problems are piling up almost everywhere. In China, sales plunged by 23% after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier claimingto use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald’s and KFC. In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because ofunrest in Ukraine and the sour anti-western mood in Russia. Around 200 of McDonald’s 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated food-safety checks. Ten have been closed."
"But the worst crisis is in the US, where McDonald’s has around 40% of its restaurants. Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.","But it is in the US, where McDonald’s has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis is deepest.

"Sales have fallen every month for 12 monthsin the US. Many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as Chipotle Mexican Grill. The number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit McDonald’s once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.","McDonald’s has seen 12 straight months of falling sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter.

"Another problem is that McDonald’s hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners – they said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers. Many people also believe that McDonald’s is less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle. Chipotle uses antibiotic-free meat and “locally sourced, seasonal” ingredients.","To add to the company’s problems, McDonald’s hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers.

"McDonald’s asked customers for their opinions in the US in October. Someone asked “Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers?” – ‘pink slime’ is the beef  ller that is used for dog food. McDonald’s stopped using this meat productin 2012 but McDonald’s Chief Executive Don Thompson said the company still had to improve people’s opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients.",The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonald’s was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US in October. “Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers?” was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website – this refers to the controversial beef  ller used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it “ t” for human consumption.

The meat product, banned in Europe since the BSE crisis, was dropped by McDonald’s in 2012."
"McDonald’s has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices. But, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.","Yet, just as McDonald’s has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food they think is fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices. Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower.","But pink slime has left doubts in US consumers’ minds. “Does McDonald’s beef contain worms?” asked another person (“No. Gross. End ofstory,” replied the company). Others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs or whether the McRib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats. McDonald’s Chief Executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of its ingredients."
"But Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic said that it wasn’t fair to say that McDonald’s was more expensive than its rivals. “Prices have gone up but they haven’t gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the US.” Prices at McDonald’s have increased by 4.8% since 2009, much less than the fast-food average (up 19.4%).","The “expensive” tag was unjusti ed, said Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic. “Prices have indeed gone up but they haven’t gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US.” Prices at McDonald’s have increased by 4.8% since 2009, well below the fast-food average (up 19.4%), and the cost of “fast casual” eating, a category that includes Chipotle, is up 16.9%. US consumer prices rose 11% over the same period.","Yet, just as McDonald’s has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy serviceat low prices.

"But people are right when they complain that the queues are longer. McDonald’s has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items – its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make. “I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,”said Chapman.","But critics are not wrong about the longer queues.

US consumer prices rose 11% over the same period."
"McDonald managers are promising to improve people’s opinions about its food in the US. Thompson has promised more organic food and “build your own burgers”. But, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. How can the company have simpler menus and, at the same time, a larger selection of  llings? “They want to simplify the menu but also offer ‘build your own burgers’ – that sounds tricky,” said consumer expert Mark Kalinowski. Only four out of McDonald’s 14,000 US restaurants have tested “build your own burger”, he said. “Right now, we are sceptical; we would like to seemore detail.”","In the UK, McDonald’s has turned around its business, which makes Britain a rare bright spot for the company. A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-  have given McDonald’s a broad appeal in the UK, said consultant Peter Martin, adding that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonald’s restaurant at least once in the last six months.","But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues.

"Sales are falling but McDonald’s continues to expand around the world: by the end of 2014,it expects to open 1,400 new restaurants. Kalinowski thinks that McDonald’s sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years.","Executives are promising to fight misconceptions about its food in its home market.

,"Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have 1,400 new restaurants. Kalinowski expects McDonald’s market share will continue to shrink but he, too, warned against writing off the company. “We think it will be number one for not just years but decades to come.”","“They want to simplify the menu but enhance its ability to customize and that sounds tricky,” said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets.
