"According to a recent scienti c study, organic food has more healthy antioxidants thanregular food. It also has fewer toxic metals and pesticides. The international team that did the study suggests that changing to organic fruit and vegetables could be as healthy as adding one or two portions of the recommended ‘ ve a day’ fruit and vegetables.","Organic food has more of the antioxidants linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis so far. The international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ‘ ve a day’ fruit and vegetables.","Organic food has more of the antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis to date. The internationalteam behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ‘ ve a day’."
"The team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert, concludes that there are big differences between organic and non-organic food. Organic food has between 19% and 69% more antioxidants. It is the  rst study to show clear differences between organic and regular fruits, vegetables and cereals.","The team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert, concludes that there are “statistically signi cant” differences, with a range of antioxidants being “substantially higher” – between 19% and 69% – in organic food. It is the  rst study to demonstrate clear differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.","The team, led by Professor Carlo Leifert at Newcastle University, concludes that there are “statistically signi cant, meaningful” differences, with a range of antioxidants being “substantially higher” – between 19% and 69% – in organic food. It is the  rst study to demonstrate clear and wide-ranging differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals."
The researchers say that the higher levels of antioxidants have the same effect as “one to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables that people should eat every day”. They say this means that organic food is better for our health.,The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to “one to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant in terms of human nutrition”.,"The researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to “one to twoof the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant and meaningful in terms of human nutrition, if information linking these compounds to the health bene ts associated with increased fruit, vegetable and wholegrain consumption is con rmed”."
"The  ndings will make people argue even more about whether or not organic food is better for people. Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at King’s College London, said the research showed some differences. “But are the differences relevant? I am not sure.” He also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than regular crops.","The  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people. Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at King’s College London, said the research did showsome differences. “But the question is are they within natural variation? And are they nutritionally relevant? I am not convinced.” He added, “Leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.” He also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops.","The  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people, with one expert saying that the  ndings were exaggerated. Tom Sanders, a professor of nutrition at King’s College London, said the research did show some differences. “But the question is are they within natural variation?And are they nutritionally relevant? I am not convinced.” He said Leifert’s work had caused controversy in the past. “Leifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.” Sanders added the research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops."
"The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world– more than ever before – which examine differences between organic and regular fruit, vegetables and cereals. Helen Browning, who supports organic farming, said that the research showed that how we farm affects the quality of the food we eat.","The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world – more than ever before – which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals. “The important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat,” said Helen Browning, chief executive of the Soil Association, which campaigns for organic farming.","The results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world – more than ever before – which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals. “The crucially important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat,” said Helen Browning, chief executive of the Soil Association, which campaigns fororganic farming."
"Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants reduce the risk of serious diseases, including diseases of the heart and certain cancers. The researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in regular crops. They found four times more pesticides on regular crops than on organic food.","Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants “have previously been linked toa reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers”. The researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. Pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food.","Plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to  ght back against pest attacks, so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays. But, the scientists say other reasons may be important, such as organic varieties being bred for toughness and not being overfed with arti cial fertilizers."
"People will criticize the research: including so many studies in the analysis could make the results unreliable. Also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in regular food are still below recommended limits. But, the researchers say that cadmium stays in the body and that some people may want to avoid this. They also say that recommended limits are for single pesticides and not for the mixture of chemicals that farmers use on regular crops.","The research is certain to be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor-quality work makes the results unreliable. Also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still far below recommended limits. But, the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this, andthat pesticide limits are set individually, not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops.","Leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants “have previously been linked toa reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers”. But, they also note that no long-term studies showing health bene ts from a broad organic diet have yet been conducted. The researchers found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. Pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food. The research was funded by the EU and an organic farming charity."
"Another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates, different types of soil and different types of crops; they may not be the result of organic farming. But, the biggest criticism will be about possible health bene ts. The most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence of health bene ts. “Other studies did not  nd evidence that organic foods are much more nutritious than regular foods,”it found.","A further criticism of the research is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming. The greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of possible health bene ts. The most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. “The published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritious than conventional foods,” it found.","The research is certain to be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor-quality work skews the results, although the team did “sensitivity analyses”and found that excluding weaker work did not signi cantly change the outcome. Also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still well below regulatory limits. But, the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this, and that pesticide limits are set individually, not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops."
"Sanders agrees. “You are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food,” he said. “What is most important is what you eat, not whether it’s organic or regular. It’s whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all.”","This was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the UK Food Standards Agency. The 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues. Sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. “You are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food,” he said. “What is most important is what you eat, not whether it’s organic or conventional. It’s whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all.”","A further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming, though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences. The greatest criticism, however,will be over the suggestions of potential health bene ts. The most recent major analysis, which took in 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. “The published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritiousthan conventional foods,” it found."
"Shoppers say that healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemicals (53%) are the main reasons they buy organic food. Browning said: “This research supports what people think about organic food. In other countries, there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. We hope that now the UK will accept organic food like people in the rest of Europe.","Opinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons given by shoppers for buying organic produce. But, many also say care for the environment (44%) and animal welfare (31%) are important, and also taste (35%). Browning said: “This research con rms what people think about organic food. In other countries, there have, for a long time, been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. We hope these  ndings will bring the UK into line with the rest of Europe.”","This was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the UK Food Standards Agency, though the latter considered just 11 studies. The 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues. Sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. “You are not going to be better nourished if you eat organic food,” he said. “What is most important is what you eat, not whether it’s organic or conventional. It’s whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all. People are buying into a lifestyle system. They get an assurance it is not being grown with chemicals and is not grown by big business.”"
