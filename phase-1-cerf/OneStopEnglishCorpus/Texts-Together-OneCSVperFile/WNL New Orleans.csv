"It is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the world’s drinking capital, New Orleans, Louisiana. Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans city government has begun trying to reduce noise problems. The city is now stricter on noise in bars and nightclubs – and, at the same time, it has introduced new rules on noise.","It is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the world’s drinking capital, New Orleans, Louisiana. Many other cities have banned indoor smoking but New Orleans is different – it attracts tourists with a “let the good times roll” attitude. An indoor smoking ban in New Orleans could have unique consequences.","You can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the world’s drinking capital, New Orleans, Louisiana. City after city has banned indoor smoking but that’s different because other cities don’t attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a “let the good times roll” attitude,as New Orleans does. An indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as New Orleans’s cultural ecosystem itself."
"“It is the wrong time for this,” complains bar-owner William Walker. He hates the anti-smoking law. “If they force people outside the bar to smoke, it is going to increase the tension that’s already there.”","Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans city government has begun trying to turndown the volume a bit. With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new “noise ordinance”.","As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, New Orleans city government has, since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new “noise ordinance” (read: music ordinance)."
"Many of New Orleans’s best bars are in quiet neighbourhoods. Martha Wood lives besidea loud bar that has live music. “The bar wasone reason I bought the house so I won’t ever complain about the noise,” says Wood. She also manages a live-music bar.","“This is just the wrong time for something like this,” complains bar-owner William Walker, who hates the anti-smoking law. “Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to increase the tension that’s already there.”","“This is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this,” complains bar- owner William Walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates the anti-smoking law. “Forcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension that’s already there.”"
"The Maple Leaf club became smoke-free in 2014. Another club also became smoke-free because performers asked for smoke-free nights. “A lot of the performance venues were already startingto show that consideration to performers. I wish the city had just let that happen, not force the ban into every bar that doesn’t have music,” says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge.","Many of New Orleans’s best bars and live music venues are in quiet residential neighbourhoods. This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming. But, recently, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleans’s musical personality feels at risk.","Many of New Orleans’s best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods. This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming. Recently, though, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleans’s musical personality feels at stake."
"Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio. Another bar, Lost Love Lounge, doesn’t have a patio. The owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban – before,he felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar popular. “I couldn’t ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city,” says Douville. “People think I have that choice. But, if I make a no-smoking rule, they will choose another bar with smoking.”","Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. “I bought the house partly because of the bar so I won’t ever complain about the noise,” says Wood, who also manages a live-music bar. This bar became one of New Orleans’s  rst ever bars legally banned from serving drinks to go, after a series of noise issues in 2013 – including complaints about the loud smokers outside.","Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. “The bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so I won’t ever complain about the noise,” says Wood, who also manages a live-music bar which, following a series of noise issues in 2013 (including complaints about the loud smokers outside), became one of New Orleans’s  rst ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go. “Now, any small infraction could get us shut down,” says Wood. “We recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we can’t open the doors at night because ofthe ‘noise’.”"
"Many small business owners also fear that the smoke-free rule will make them lose money. Neil Timms owns an English pub and saw a smoking ban before, in England. “Back home in England, every pub I knew closed because of the smoking ban,” remembers Timms of England’s ban, which began in 2007. To avoid the same problems, he’s spending money to build a patio.","The Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014. The same happened at another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. “A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesn’t host music,” says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge.","The Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. “A lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesn’t host music,” says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge, which went smoke-free in 2013 because, she says, “The horn players and the singers, they asked us for it.”"
"But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity. “There are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didn’t want to smell like smoke for the next seven days – now, those people can come.” Douville isn’t worried about noise complaints: “No court is going to say a bar is a ‘nuisance’ after the city has introduced a smoking ban that forces you to go outside!”he says.","Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban – he’d previously felt forced tolive with smoke to keep his bar going. “There’s no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without a ban throughout the whole city,” says Douville. “People act like I have that choice,as a business owner. But, if I make that rule, customers walk down the block to a barwith smoking.”","Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban – he’d previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar  nancially viable. “There’s no way I could have banned smokingin my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city,” says Douville. “People act like I have that choice, as a business owner. But, if I make that rule, they walk down the block to a bar with smoking. So I need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody.”"
"Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: “The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well,” she says. “The owners need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. The idea that we can’t have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. We can have clean air without noise problems – I think it’s about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.”","Many small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before, in England. “Back home in England, every pub I knew closed within a year of the smoking ban,” remembers Timms of the UK’s ban, begun in 2007. He doesn’t want his pub to close so he’s spending money to build a patio.","Many small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss.

To avoid the same fate, he’s spending money to build a patio."
Many people were worried that the police would not have time to give bars warnings and  nes. So the health department will do it. Bar customers must “ ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smoking”.,"But Douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity. “There are lots of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didn’t want to smell like smoke for the next seven days – we’re now an option for all those people.” Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints: “No court is going to say a bar is a ‘nuisance’ after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!” he says.","Lost Love’s Douville, though, feels the ban tobe a great business opportunity. “The number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didn’t want to smell like smoke for the next seven days – we’re now an option for all those people.” Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does: “No court is gonna label a bar a ‘nuisance’ after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!” he says. “I want to see a judge reconcile ‘no loitering’ with ‘no smoking inside’.”"
"Geoff Douville says that he’s used to noise complaints. “You will see: the neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to bethe same ones who wanted the smoking ban. Of course they’re going to complain,” he adds. “But it doesn’t mean they’re going to win.”","Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: “The responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well,” she says. “The owners and bartenders need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities.

I think it’s about communication and creating partnerships between the communities andthe businesses.”"
,"Cantrell recognizes that the city is different. “How is New Orleans different from the rest of the country? New Orleans is known as a place where you can relax and have fun,” she says. “New Orleans needs to stand up and say ‘We care about our people.’ The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.”","Cantrell does acknowledge the city’s uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban. “How is New Orleans different from the rest of the country?

The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.” She adds, “New Orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke.”"

For this reason alone, Neil Timms says he’ll comply with the ban: “I don’t want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo and gets beaten up.”","Many worried that the already strained New Orleans Police Department didn’t need any part in policing smokers.

For this reason alone, Neil Timms says he’ll comply with the ban: “I don’t want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of ’em and gets beaten up.”"
,"Unworried, Geoff Douville says that he’s used to noise complaints by now. “You will see: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban.” In the end, Douville shares Cantrell’s optimism. “Of course they’re goingto complain,” he accepts. “But it doesn’t mean they’re going to win.”","Unworried, Geoff Douville says that he’s usedto noise complaints by now so bring on the ban. “Watch: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with.” In the end, Douville shares Cantrell’s win-win optimism. “Of course they’re gonna complain,” he accepts. “But it doesn’t mean they’re gonna win.”"
