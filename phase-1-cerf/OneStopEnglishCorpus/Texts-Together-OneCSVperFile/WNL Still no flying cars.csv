"We do not yet live in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities. Experts agree that economic and population changes, new technology, and environmental concerns are having a big effect on transportation.","We may not yet be living in an age of  yingcars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is just as exciting and almost as far-fetched. Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally changing transportation. “It’s a very dynamic time,” said transport expert Robert Puentes. “There’s a tighter connection between transportation and the economic health of cities and its impacton people.”","We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. “It’s a very dynamic time,” said Robert Puentes, of the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program think- tank. “There’s a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.”"
"With an ageing transport infrastructure, citiesin the US have to change and improve their transportation. Experts and scientists now realize that old ways of reducing traf c congestion aren’t enough to solve the problems of population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now an environmental problem.","As the transport infrastructure grows old, cities across the US are forced to rede ne what transportation is. Urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are now realizing that old methods focused on reducing traf c congestion aren’t enough to solve problems like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now a key part of protecting the environment.","As the average US commute lengthens andthe country’s infrastructure ages badly, cities across the US are being forced to rede ne what transportation is. Increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traf c congestion aren’t enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a city’s larger sustainability efforts."
"Big US cities like Los Angeles and Chicago are adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks. At the same time, they are creating advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment.","Big US cities like Los Angeles and Chicagoare working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks.

Here are three of the key ideas that experts predict will change transportation in the future.,Here are three key ideas that experts predict will in uence transportation in the coming years.,"Here are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years."
"ConnectivityTaxi-sharing services like Uber and apps like Waze, which  nds the quickest routes for drivers, are completely changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city. Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era.","ConnectivityRide-sharing services like Uber – taxis booked via smartphone – and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city. Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to Allan Clelland, an expert on transportation technology.","Connectivity The rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft – essentially taxis booked at the click ofa smartphone button – and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city.

"According to a recent study, people born in the 1990s are using cars less than older generations. According to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than older generations did at the same time in their lives. And, people who still drive cars are experiencing less traf c thanks to Waze.","According to a recent study, car travel has reduced among people born in the 1990s compared to previous generations.

"Traf c congestion is improving in other ways, too. At the moment, a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but that’s all. Companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.",People still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze. Experts say the traf c app has reduced congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers. But it has also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods.,"Meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze. Experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but alsoled to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. This has angered residents, who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life."
"AutomationWe have known about driverless cars eversince Google began testing the vehicles in2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. But, there is already some automation of cars. Automation will probably happen in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: vehicles that are connected electronically and travel one behind another.","This trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. Currently, a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but that’s all. Companies are working to develop technology that will allow a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.","This trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows.

"The idea of a fully automated transportation system is interesting because it could improve safety – people’s mistakes won’t cause accidents any more. It could also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion. But, it will take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.","AutomationDriverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace.

"Environmental concernThe world is trying to slow down climate change and countries and cities are trying to reduce emissions. These things could have a big effect on the future of transportation and lead tozero- and low-emission vehicles and apps that encourage more walking, cycling and carpooling.","To see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.","To see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380."
" When thinking about the future of transportation, it’s also important to think about why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. Technologies that reduce the need for those trips – for example, online meetings or online work – could also have a big effect on transportation.","Environmental concernAs the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change and countries and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policiescould also have a big effect on the future of transportation.

,"When considering the future of transportation, it’s also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. Technologies that reduce the need for those trips – for example, virtual meetings or telecommuting – could also have a big effect on transportation.","Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. If their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. “We’re going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,” she said."
