"Changes to US surveillance law, introduced
under President Bush and renewed under
Obama in December 2012, made it possible
for the NSA to access the information. The
program allows a large amount of in-depth
surveillance on live communications and
stored information. The law allows the
NSA to watch customers of companies
who live outside the US or Americans who
communicate with people outside the US.","The NSA access became possible because

"The document says that some of the world’s
largest internet companies have been part
of the information-sharing program since
its introduction in 2007. Microsoft – whose
advertising slogan is “Your privacy is our
priority” – was the first, in December 2007.
It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google,
Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in
2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally
Apple, which joined the program in 2012.","The revelation of the PRISM program

providers due to come online. Collectively, the
companies cover the vast majority of online

networks. The extent and nature of the data
collected from each company varies."
"The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
(FISA) was changed in December 2012.
At the time, several US senators were
worried that the law might increase the
amount of surveillance and they could see
problems with some of the safeguards in
the law. When the change in the law was
first introduced, its supporters said that
one safeguard would be that the NSA
could not get electronic communications
without the permission of the telecom
and internet companies that control the
data. But the PRISM program makes that
permission unnecessary, because it allows
the government to take directly from the
companies’ servers communications that
include email, video and voice chat,
videos, photos, file transfers and social
networking details.","Under US law, companies must comply with
requests for users’ communications, but
the PRISM program allows the intelligence
services direct access to the companies’
servers. The NSA document notes that the
operations have “the help of communications
providers in the US”.","Companies are legally obliged to comply with
requests for users’ communications under
US law, but the PRISM program allows the
intelligence services direct access to the
companies’ servers. The NSA document
notes the operations have the “assistance of
communications providers in the US”."
"A senior administration official said: “Section
702 of the FISA does not allow the targeting
of any US citizen or of any person who is
within the United States. It targets only non-
US persons outside the US.","During the renewal of the FISA Amendments
Act (FAA) in December 2012, several
US senators warned about the high level
of surveillance the law might allow and
shortcomings in the safeguards it introduces.
When the FAA was first introduced, its
supporters argued that one safeguard
would be the fact that the NSA could not
get electronic communications without the
permission of the telecom and internet
companies that control the data. But the
PRISM program makes that permission
unnecessary, because it allows the agency
to take the communications directly off the
companies’ servers, communications that
include email, video and voice chat, videos,
photos, voice-over-IP (Skype, for example)
chats, file transfers and social
networking details.","The revelation also supports concerns raised
by several US senators during the renewal of
the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) in December
2012, who warned about the scale of surveillance
the law might enable and shortcomings in the
safeguards it introduces. When the FAA was first
enacted, defenders of the statute argued that a
significant check on abuse would be the NSA’s
inability to obtain electronic communications
without the consent of the telecom and internet
companies that control the data. But the PRISM program renders that consent unnecessary, as it
allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize
the communications off the companies’ servers."
"“Information that is collected under this
program is some of the most important and
valuable intelligence information we collect
and we use it to protect our nation from a
wide variety of threats.”","The PRISM program allows the NSA, the
world’s largest surveillance organization,
to get targeted communications without requesting them from the service providers
and without needing individual court orders.
With this program, the NSA is able to reach
directly into the servers of the companies and
get both stored communications and
live communications.","A chart prepared by the NSA, contained within
the top-secret document, highlights the breadth
of the data it is able to obtain: email, video
and voice chat, videos, photos, voice-over-IP
(Skype, for example) chats, file transfers, social
networking details and more. The document
is recent, dating to April 2013. Such a leak is
extremely rare in the history of the NSA, which
prides itself on maintaining a high level of secrecy."
,"A senior administration official said in a
statement: “The Guardian and Washington
Post articles refer to collection of
communications under Section 702 of the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).
This law does not allow the targeting of any
US citizen or of any person who is within
the United States. The program is overseen
by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court, the Executive Branch and Congress.
Only non-US persons outside the US are
targeted.” The program must limit the
information it gets, keeps and disseminates
about US citizens.","The PRISM program allows the NSA, the

Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch and

dissemination of incidentally acquired information
about US persons."
