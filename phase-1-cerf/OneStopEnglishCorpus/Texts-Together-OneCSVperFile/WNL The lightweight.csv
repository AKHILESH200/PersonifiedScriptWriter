"Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast. He took some photos of colourful  sh with his  rst underwater camera and he was sure they would be great. But, when he looked at the photos later, they were brown and murky. The photos were bad because he was holding his breath underwater so he didn’t have enough time to take the pictures. He thought that all he needed was a little more time to photograph the  sh in their natural environment.","Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast and he was sure he had taken some great photos of colourful  sh with his  rst underwater camera.

But, when he looked at the results on dry land, the images were brown and murky. Having taken the pictures while holding his breath underwater, he blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots. All he needed, the industrial designer thought, was a little more time to properly capture the  sh in theirnatural environment."
"To help with this problem, he has invented the Express Dive. It is a re llable air storage device, which you hold in your mouth. It lets you swim underwater for two minutes. It is somewhere between snorkelling, which is very limited, and scuba diving, which gives people the freedom to breathe underwater but needs heavy and expensive gear. The prototype of his invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle.","He decided to invent something to make that little extra time a reality and the result is his invention of the Express Dive – a re llable air storage device, which is held in the mouth and lets people swim underwater for two minutes.

"“I wanted to let people to do more – not just get underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath,” says Redmond, 27. In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and watch  sh in their natural environment. But all the equipment he needed was less enjoyable.","“I wanted to enable people to do more.

"“I didn’t like that I had about 50kg of equipment on me. And getting into the water was quite strange when you are used to trying to stay at the surface. It was a very surreal experience,” he says. “The real problem is that scuba diving limits what you can do. It allows you to stay underwater for longer but it takes a lot of planning. You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you – you can’t just walk on the beach and decide you want to go in. Planning is a very big part of it.”","“I was very aware of the fact that I had about 50kg of equipment on me and going under the water felt strange when you are used to trying to keep yourself at the surface.

"It was during a  nal-year project for his degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive. The device has two main parts. When above the surface, the device takes in air through a vent in the mouthpiece. The air is compressed and stored in a tank, which has a light that  ashes green when it is full. When it has  nished taking in air, the vent closes and, when the person dives, air is fed back through the mouthpiece. The light turns from green to red when theair starts to runs out. The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll.","It was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive.

The device has two main parts. When above the surface,the unit uses a fan to suck in air via a vent inthe mouthpiece. The air, accelerated around the motor-driven turbine, is compressed through a series of valves and stored in the attached tank, which has a display light that  ashes green when it is full. When air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the user dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece."
Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to a snorkel. They have tested the prototype in parts. Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes of air into the device and that a person can hold the device in their mouth,"The light turns from green to red when the air start to run out. The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll. “When you put the compressor into the unit with all of the restof the stuff, the batteries and the electronics, the dif cult thing was to make it small enough so that people could hold it in their mouths,”Redmond says.","That display, which is in the user’s eyeline, then acts as a health bar turning from green to red when the air runs low. The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to be re lled. “When you put the compressor into the unit with all of the rest of the stuff, the batteries and the electronics and the membranes for the scuba delivery, the big trick was to be able to get it small enough so that it would be able to be held through the teeth and out of the mouth,” Redmond says."
"What he has not yet done is test the device ona diver, completely underwater for two minutes. But, with enough testing, Redmond is surethe device will work well and that it will not be dangerous for swimmers underwater. The device will probably cost £280, he says, and it will probably weigh from 1kg to 3kg.","Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel. He compares it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater. “It is an extension of the body’s ability to store air,” he says. The prototype has been tested in parts. Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes’ worth of air into the unit and that the design can be held in thediver’s mouth.","The electrics are shielded from the water in the casing and are recharged using inductive power transfer – a system using an electromagnetic  eld, similar to the pads which can wirelessly charge mobile phones, so that there is no need for exposed wires."
"Perhaps some people think two minutes ofair is not enough and is not much better than snorkelling. But, Redmond says two minutes can make all the difference underwater. The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater. “Two minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that,” he says.","What he has not yet done is test the device on a diver, fully submerged for two minutes. But, with enough testing, Redmond is con dent he can get a fully working device that will not endanger swimmers underwater.

,"To anyone who thinks two minutes of air isno more than a very small improvement on snorkelling, Redmond says it could make a big difference underwater. The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater, he says. “Two minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that,” he says.","Redmond recently came runner-up for the International James Dyson Award, which will give him £5,000 to further develop the project. Early indications are that the device would be priced at £280, he says, and it is likely to weigh anywhere from 1kg to 3kg depending on the safety features needed. "
