"The critics usually analyse the novels of wellknown
British author David Mitchell in detail. But,
he is not worried about the critics this time. He
completed his latest book at 1am one Tuesday
morning before a car arrived to take him to the
airport to catch a flight to Norway. No one will see
this novel until 2114.","Well-known British author David Mitchell is used

"Mitchell is the second author to be part of the
Future Library project. For the project, they
planted 1,000 trees in 2014 in Oslo’s Nordmarka
forest. The first author, Margaret Atwood, gave
the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon
to the project in 2015. Each year for the next
hundred years, an author will write a novel that
people will only read in 2114, when the trees are
cut down to make paper to make the books.","Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish

"“It’s a little bit of hope at a time when there is
lots of very depressing news. It shows that we
have a chance of civilization in a hundred years,”
said Mitchell. “Everything is telling us that we’re
doomed but the Future Library brings hope that
we are stronger than we think: that we will be
here, that there will be trees, that there will be
books and readers, and civilization.”","“It’s a little glimmer of hope in a season when

"Mitchell said that writing this book made him
feel free “because I won’t be around to know if
people think it’s good or bad. But, before me was
Margaret Atwood and next year I’m sure there will
be another brilliant writer. So my book had better
be good. I would look such a fool if they opened
my book in 2114 and it wasn’t any good.”","Mitchell said he found writing the book “quite
liberating because I won’t be around to take the
consequences of this being good or bad. But, I’m
sandwiched between Margaret Atwood and no
doubt some other brilliant writer. So, it had better
be good. I’d look such a fool if they opened it in
2114 and it wasn’t any good.”","Mitchell said he found writing the book “quite

"Mitchell says that he usually “polishes and
polishes” his writing. “I polish too much. But, this
was very different – I wrote till the final minute.
So, the first two-thirds are polished and the final
third I didn’t have time. And, I felt free.”","Mitchell says that he usually “polishes and
polishes” his writing. “Actually, I over-polish.

the Man Booker for his novels number9dream

two-thirds were polished and the final third I didn’t
have time. And, it was a liberation.”"
"The creator of the Future Library asked writers
to write on “the theme of imagination and
time”. Mitchell revealed only the name of the
manuscript, From Me Flows What You Call Time,
during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods
next to where the 1,000 trees are planted. The
title comes from a piece of music by Japanese
composer Toru Takemitsu. Mitchell only told us
that his book is “longer than I thought it would
be.” He said nothing more.","Future Library creator, Paterson, asked the
writers to write on “the theme of imagination

"In the forest, Mitchell read a short story and a
poem. This small section of forest will be carefully
managed for the next 98 years before it becomes
Future Library’s manuscripts.","Handing over his text in the forest, Mitchell read
his audience of children and adults a short story
and William Wordsworth’s A slumber did my spirit
seal. Its ending, “Rolled round in earth’s diurnal
course / With rocks, and stones, and trees”, felt
appropriate in this small section of forest, which
will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years
before it is turned into Future
Library’s manuscripts.","Handing over his text in the forest, sheltered from

earth’s diurnal course / With rocks, and stones,

"“How vain to think my writing will be of interest to
future generations. But, it is the opposite of vain
to work hard on a manuscript that nobody will
ever congratulate you for and say: ‘Good job’ or
‘I loved the bit where she did that and he did this
...’” Mitchell wrote.","“How vain to think that my scribblings will be
of enduring interest to future generations. Yet,
how low-key and understated, to slave over a
manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate
you for and say: ‘Nice one’ or ‘God, I loved the

wrote in a piece for the Future Library.","“How vain to suppose the scribblings of little

"They will seal his manuscript and put it next to
Atwood’s manuscript in a room in Oslo’s new
public library, which will open in 2019. The
manuscript is now, says the author, “gone from
me like a coin I’ve dropped in a river”.","His manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and

gone from me as a coin dropped in a river”.","His manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and
