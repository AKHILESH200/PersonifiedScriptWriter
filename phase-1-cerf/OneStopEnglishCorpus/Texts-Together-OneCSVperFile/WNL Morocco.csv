"The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is on the edgeof the Sahara Desert. It is now the centre for four linked solar mega-plants. The plants, together with hydro and wind, will give Morocco, in north Africa, nearly half of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020. The project is a key part of Morocco’s plans to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower.","The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. It is on the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the centre of the North African country’s “Ouallywood”  lm industry, where scenes from movies such as Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones were  lmed.","The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions.

"When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. The  rst phase, called Noor 1, will be ready in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is more expensive than the solar panels that we can see on roofs all over the world but it will be able to produce power even after the sun goes down.","Now the city, known as the “door of the desert”, is the centre for a complex of four linked solar mega- plants, which, together with hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Morocco’s electricity from renewable energy by 2020. The project is a key part of Morocco’s ambitions to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower.","Now, the trading city, nicknamed the “door of the desert”, is the location for another blockbuster – a complex of four linked solar mega-plants, which, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Morocco’s electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key plank in Morocco’s ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower."
"People have known for many years that the desert is a useful place to produce solar energy. In 1986, the German scientist Gerhard Knies said that the world’s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to make power for all the people in the world for a whole year. But the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed.","When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. The  rst phase, called Noor 1, will be ready in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that you can see on roofs all over the world. But it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down.","When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the  rst phase, called Noor 1, will go live in November 2015. The mirror technology it usesis less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down."
"At Noor 1, there are 500,000 moon-shaped solar mirrors. The 800 rows of mirrors follow the sun across the sky. They whir quietly every few minutes.","The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the world’s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide power for all the people in the world for a whole year. But the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed.","The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades.

The challenge, though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required."
"When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will be as big as Morocco’s capital city, Rabat, and make 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough for a million homes.","As engineers  nish Noor 1, its 500,000 moon-shaped solar mirrors glitter in the desert.

The 800 rows follow the sun asit tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east."
Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco’s renewable energy supply by 2020. Wind and hydro will make up the other two-thirds.,"When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will need a space as big as Morocco’s capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough to power a million homes.","When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Morocco’s capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (MW) of electricity, enough to power a million homes. Noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160MW."
"“We are very proud of this project,” Morocco’s environment minister, Hakima el-Haite said. “I think it is the most important solar plant in the world.”","Morocco’s environment minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same effects on the region this century that oil production had in the last century. But the $9bn project was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said.","Morocco’s Environment Minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. But the $9bn project to make her country’s deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said."
"The Noor 2 and 3 plants, which are planned to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours. This will mean that there could be solar energy available 24/7 in the Sahara and the rest of the region.","“We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from other countries and that has big consequencesfor our state budget,” el-Haite told the Guardian. “So, when we heard about the possibilities of solar energy, we thought, ‘Why not?’”","“We are not an oil producer. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,” el-Haite told the Guardian. “We also used to subsidize fossil fuels, which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought, ‘Why not?’”"
"“We are already involved in transportation linesto take energy to the south of Morocco and Mauritania,” says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of the national renewable energy investment company. But he says the project will go further – even as far as the Middle East.",Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco’s renewable energy supply by 2020.

"Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Morocco is making plans with Tunisia and they hope to export energy north across the Mediterranean, too.","“We are very proud of this project,” el-Haite said. “I think it is the most important solar plant in the world.”","“We are very proud of this project,” el-Haite said. “I think it is the most important solar plant in the world.”"
"“We believe that it’s possible to export energy to Europe but,  rst, we have to build the connections, which don’t yet exist,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.","Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours – this gives the possibility of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region.","Each parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focused on a steel pipeline carrying a ‘heat transfer solution’ (HTF) that is warmed to 393C as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine. There, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy- generating turbines."
"Until that time, the solar energy will be used in Morocco. They might one day use solar energy to remove salt from sea water.","The  rst part of the project is nearly completed and Morocco has bigger international ambitions. We are already involved in transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania, says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Societe dInvestissements Energetiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm. But he says the projects effects will go further  even as far as the Middle East.","The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heatenergy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. The mirrors are spaced in tier formations to minimize damage from sand blown up by desert winds."
,"Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Moroccois making plans with Tunisia and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean are a key goal.","Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours – opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region."
,"“We believe that it’s possible to export energyto Europe but,  rst, we have to build the interconnectors which don’t yet exist,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.","“The biggest challenge we faced was being able to  nish the project on time with the performance level we needed to achieve,” said Rashid al-Bayad, the project director."
,"In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs. This could one day include water desalination, which is very useful in a country that is having more and more droughts as the climate warms.","But, even as the  rst phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a  rst step, says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Societe dInvestissements Energetiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm. But he says the projects ultimate impact will go far wider  even as far as the Middle East. The ultimate objective given by his majestythe king is Mecca."""
,"About $9bn has been invested in the Noor Complex, much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and supported by Moroccan government guarantees. Energy subsidies from Morocco’s King Mohammed VI have stopped the cost from being transferred to normal people."," Whether that ambition is achieved remains tobe seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Talks are ongoing with Tunisia and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal."
,"Over a thousand, mostly Moroccan, workers are still racing to  x electric wires, take down scaffolding and insulate steel pipelines. They hurry past in yellow and orange safety vests, working 12-hour shifts beneath the Atlas mountains. They wear hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs.","“We believe that it’s possible to export energyto Europe but,  rst, we would have to build the interconnectors which don’t yet exist,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman. “Speci cally, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and, then, start exporting.”"
,"“We’ve done the construction and, now, we willsee how these projects look when they start,” says Hajar Lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from Meknes. “It is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance.”","Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmitthe energy to France. The EU has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member country’s power can be transported abroad by cableby 2020."
