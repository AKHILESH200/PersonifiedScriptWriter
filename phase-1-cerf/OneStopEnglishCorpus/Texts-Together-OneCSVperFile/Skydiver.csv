"Felix Baumgartner stood at the edge of
space above New Mexico and paused for a
moment. It was a small step away from the
capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to
Earth. “Our guardian angel will take care of
you,” said mission control, and
Baumgartner jumped.","Felix Baumgartner stood at the edge of space above New Mexico and paused slightly. It was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to Earth. “Our guardian angel will take care of you,” said mission control, and the man known as Fearless Felix jumped.","Standing at the edge of space above the deserts of New Mexico, Felix Baumgartner paused slightly. It was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to Earth. “Our guardian angel will take care of you,” said mission control, and the man known as Fearless Felix jumped."
"Ten frightening minutes later, the Austrian
landed back on Earth. He fell at speeds
of up to 725 miles per hour, and he broke
three world records. He became the world’s
first supersonic skydiver when he broke the
sound barrier. “We love you Felix,” shouted
his team in the control room.","Ten terrifying minutes later, the Austrian landed back on Earth. He had reached speeds of up to 725 miles per hour, and broken three world records, including becoming the world’s first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at Mach 1.24. “We love you Felix,” cheered the control room. Baumgartner raised his arms in a victory salute.","Ten heart-stopping minutes later the Austrian landed back on Earth, after reaching speeds of up to 725mph, and breaking three world records, including becoming the world’s first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at Mach 1.24. “We love you Felix,” cheered the control room as his mother, Ava Baumgartner, wept. Baumgartner, who claimed the records for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive, raised his arms in a victory salute to thank his team."
"He was wearing a special suit to protect him
against the very big pressure changes during
the jump. Without the suit, a man’s blood
would boil and his lungs would explode.
Baumgartner later said that all he could think
about was getting back alive, but he also
said: “Sometimes you have to go up really
high to see how small you are.”","He was wearing a specially designed survival suit to protect him against the enormous pressure changes during the jump. Without it, his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded. Baumgartner later told a press conference that all he could think about was getting back alive, but he added: “Sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.”","He was wearing a specially designed survival suit that kept his body intact against the hugely varying pressures that marked his drop back to Earth. Without it, his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded. Baumgartner later told a press conference: “When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you don’t think about breaking records.” He admitted all he could think about was getting back alive, but added: “Sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.”"
"His other two records were for the highest
altitude manned balloon flight and the highest
altitude skydive. The jump was on a sunny
morning in good weather. Baumgartner went
up into clear skies in an enormous balloon –
it was 30 million square cubic feet and its skin
was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich
bag. At the bottom of the balloon was a
capsule, where Baumgartner sat in his suit.","His other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive.

Baumgartner was carried up into crystal clear skies by a gigantic balloon, which measured 30 million square cubic feet and whose skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, in which Baumgartner sat in his suit."
"At the correct height, Baumgartner went
through a checklist of 40 things with his
helper Joe Kittinger. Kittinger held the record
for the highest altitude manned balloon flight
before Baumgartner. Baumgartner had a
problem with his visor. “This is very serious,
Joe,” he told Kitttinger. “I can’t see when I
breathe out.” But they decided to continue,
and a record 8 million people watched live
on YouTube.","As he reached the correct height, Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his mentor Joe Kittinger. Kittinger was the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight.","As he reached the desired height, Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 items with his mentor Joe Kittinger, the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight."
"The ascent, during which the skies slowly
turned black, took two and a half hours.
But the descent was much quicker.
Three cameras, which were attached to
Baumgartner’s suit, recorded his free-fall
of just over four minutes and then the
parachute opening.","Baumgartner had a problem with his visor. “This is very serious, Joe,” he told Kitttinger. “Sometimes it’s getting foggy when I breathe out.” But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people live on YouTube.","There was some concern that a heater for his visor was not working, causing his visor to fog. “This is very serious, Joe,” he told Kitttinger. “Sometimes it’s getting foggy when I exhale. ... I do not feel heat.” But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people as the jump was streamed live on YouTube."
"Baumgartner has done lots of dangerous
things before. He has parachuted off
buildings and mountains and once into a 600
foot deep cave. He did two practice free-falls
to prepare for this jump – one from 71,000
feet and a second from 97,000 feet. But
nothing can compare with his jump above the
town of Roswell, a place famous for its
UFO sightings.","After a two-and-a-half-hour journey up, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, the descent was much quicker. Three cameras, which were attached to Baumgartner’s suit, recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening.","The two-and-a-half-hour journey upwards, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, was matched with a rather more rapid descent."
"He was trying to break five different records:
the first human to ever break the sound
barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude
jump; the highest manned balloon flight;
the longest free-fall; and his jump platform
is probably the largest manned balloon in
history. The jump beat two of Kittinger’s
records: before, the retired US air force
colonel held the high altitude and speed
records for parachuting. Kittinger jumped
from a balloon 19 miles above the Earth in
1960 and gave advice to Baumgartner during
the ascent.","The success of the mission, and of the suit, means that astronauts might be able to survive a
high-altitude disaster, like on the space shuttle Columbia in 2003, by jumping out of their craft. Baumgartner’s top medical man in the stunt was Dr Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now working to help astronauts survive high-altitude disasters.",Three cameras attached to Baumgartner’s suit recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes – which failed to break the existing free-fall record for duration – and then the parachute opening.
"Someone asked him, “What do you want to
do next?” Baumgartner said: “I want to inspire
young people. I’d like to sit in the same place
in the next four years as Joe Kittinger. If
there is a young guy who wants to break my
record, I want to give him advice.” He said
the most exciting moment for him was when
he was standing outside the capsule “on top
of the world”. He added: “The most beautiful
moment was when I was standing on the
landing area and Mike Todd [the man who
dressed Baumgartner in his suit] came and
he had a smile on his face like a little kid.”","Baumgartner has a reputation for daring stunts. The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. He had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this jump – one from 71,000 feet and a second from 97,000 feet.

Baumgartner’s top medical man in the stunt was Dr Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts’ chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster."
"Baumgartner said that he felt like Todd’s
son. He said: “Todd was so happy that I was
alive.” Earlier, Todd said: “The world needs
a hero right now, and they have got one in
Felix Baumgartner.” This will be the last jump,
Baumgartner said. He has promised to settle
down with his girlfriend, and fly helicopters on
rescue missions in the US and Austria.","He was trying to break five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in
free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history. The stunt was planned for seven years, was sponsored by Red Bull drinks, and beat two of Kittinger’s records: before, the retired US air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960 and gave advice to Baumgartner during the ascent.","Baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of daring.

He had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this attempt – one from 71,000 feet in March and a second from 97,000 feet in July 2012. But no feat can possibly have matched his jump above the town of Roswell, a suitably chosen place famed for its connections to UFO sightings."
,"Asked after the jump what he wanted to do next, Baumgartner said: “I want to inspire a generation. I’d like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as Joe Kittinger. There is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record.” He said the most exciting moment for him was when he was standing outside the capsule “on top of the world”.
