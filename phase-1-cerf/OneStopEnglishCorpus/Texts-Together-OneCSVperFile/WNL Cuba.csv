"Hundreds of young Cubans are using a free,
unrestricted internet service in the communist
island nation. A small cultural centre in the capital
city, Havana, has suddenly become a rare source
of free wi-fi. The internationally known Cuban
artist Kcho is providing the service. Perhaps more
surprisingly, the state-owned telecommunications
company, Etecsa, is allowing the service.","Hundreds of young Cubans are using the first

when the centre gets crowded. But, in a country
where only about 5% of the population has open
access to the internet, a facility that is both free
and has no restrictions is very welcome.","People say the service is very slow, especially

"The chance to visit international news websites,
communicate with friends and family overseas
and use sites like Facebook and Twitter has
created a lot of excitement. “I come as often as I
can,” said Adonis Ortiz, 20. He is video-chatting
with his father, who lives in the US and whom he
has not seen in nine years.","The chance to click on international news

"Diplomatic and trade relations between the US
and Cuba are improving and American tech
giants such as Google and Apple may soon enter
the Cuban market. In the meantime, Cuba has
installed a high-speed fibre-optic cable under
the sea from Venezuela and internet users have
some access to Chinese equipment.","As diplomatic and trade relations between the US

"Another estimate is that a quarter of Cubans
have access to the internet – still one of the
lowest rates in the Western Hemisphere. But this
estimate measures residents who use a restricted
domestic intranet that only has certain websites
and has limited email.","Another estimate, that a quarter of Cubans

"Kcho, who has close relations with the Cuban
government, said that his actions are allowed
by the Ministry of Culture. The artist said he
wanted to encourage Cubans to become familiar
with the internet. “It’s only possible if you are
determined and if you pay for it,” Kcho told the
Associated Press. “It is expensive but the benefit
is tremendous. I have something that is great and
powerful. I can share it and I am doing so.”","Kcho has offered the public admission to his own
personal internet connection. But this is not the
action of a counter-revolutionary or
free-market rebel. Kcho was probably chosen as
the acceptable face of a government recognizing
the inevitable attractions of the internet.","Kcho has offered the public admission to his own

"Kcho’s real name is Alexis Leiva Machado. He

"Cuba has some of the lowest internet-use rates
in the world – dial-up accounts are restricted
and at-home broadband is extremely rare.
Only foreigners can pay for it because it costs
hundreds of dollars a month for the service – in
Cuba, the average salary is between $17 and
$20 a month. Kcho pays $900 a month to provide
the free wi-fi.","In the centre’s courtyard, tech-savvy young

"Since 2013, Cuban authorities have opened
hundreds of internet salons, where an hour online
costs $4.50. The speeds are far lower than the
speeds at Kcho’s studio, where they are about
two megabytes per second (mbps). A 2014 report
says that average internet connectivity speeds
are about 10.5mbps in the US. South Korea has
the fastest speeds in the world – 23.6mbps. The
average speed in the world is about 3.9mbps.","Cuba has some of the lowest connectivity rates

"Lots of people usually use Kcho’s wi-fi at the
same time so the signal strength is usually not
strong. One user said he sometimes visits in the
middle of the night, when nobody else is around,
and, then, the speed is extremely fast.","Since 2013, Cuban authorities have opened
