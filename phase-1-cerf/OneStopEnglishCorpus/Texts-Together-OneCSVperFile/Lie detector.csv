"Police and intelligence agencies around the world
have, for almost 100 years, used the polygraph, a
lie-detector test, to help catch criminals and spies.","Police and intelligence agencies around the world

"But, now, researchers in Britain and the
Netherlands have developed a new method, which
is correct (in tests) over 70% of the time. Police
stations around the world might begin using this
new method within ten years. It doesn’t monitor
movements in the face, talking too much or waving
arms – all signs that someone is lying. The new
method monitors movements in the whole body,
which can show that the person is feeling guilty.","But the polygraph could soon be defunct.
Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have
developed a new method that has a success rate,
in tests, of over 70%. This new method could be
in use in police stations around the world within a
decade. It doesn’t monitor facial tics, talking too much
or waving of arms, which are all signs that someone
is lying. The new method monitors full-body motion,
which can show that the person is feeling guilty.","The polygraph is beloved of the movies, with
countless dramatic moments showing the guilty
sweating profusely as they are hooked up."
"The polygraph is often used in the US in criminal
cases and by the FBI and CIA but is much less
popular in Europe. Many people do not believe that
it is reliable.","The polygraph is widely used in the US in criminal
cases and for security clearance for the FBI and
CIA but is much less popular in Europe. Many
people in the scientific and legal communities do
not believe that it is reliable. By contrast, the new
method has performed well in experiments.","But the invention could soon be defunct.
Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have
made a breakthrough, developing a method with
a success rate in tests of over 70% that could be
in use in police stations around the world within a
decade. Rather than relying on facial tics, talking
too much or waving of arms – all seen as tell-tale
signs of lying – the new method involves monitoring
full-body motions to provide an indicator of signs of
guilty feelings."
"The basic idea behind the new method is that liars
fidget more and that an all-body motion suit – the
kind used in films to create computer-generated
characters – will record this.","The basic thought is that liars fidget more and so
the use of an all-body motion suit – the kind used in
films to create computer-generated characters – will
record this. The suit has 17 sensors that register
movement up to 120 times per second in three
dimensions for 23 joints.","The polygraph is widely used in the US in criminal
and other cases and for security clearance for
the FBI and CIA but is much less popular in
Europe. There has been a lot of scepticism in the
scientific and legal communities about its reliability.
By contrast, the new method developed by the
researchers has performed well in experiments."
"The new method is over 70% reliable – the
polygraph is only 55% reliable. In some tests, the
success rate of the new method was more than 80%.","One of the research team, Ross Anderson,
professor of security engineering at Cambridge
University, said that years of research show that an
interviewer will know whether someone is telling the
truth, and not lies, in only about 55 times out of 100","The basic premise is that liars fidget more and so
the use of an all-body motion suit – the kind used
in films to create computer-generated characters –
will pick this up. The suit contains 17 sensors that
register movement up to 120 times per second in
three dimensions for 23 joints."
"Ross Anderson, one of the research team, said:
“Guilty people fidget more and we can now
measure this.”","He said the new method, by contrast, was right over
70% of the time. And he was confident they would
be able to do better. In some tests, the team has
already achieved more than 80%.","One of the research team, Ross Anderson,
professor of security engineering at Cambridge
University, said: “Decades of deception research
show that the interviewer will tell truth from lies only
slightly better than random, about 55 out of 100."
"The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman
John Larson. It records changes in pulse, blood
pressure, sweating and breathing to find out if
someone is lying.","Anderson said: “Guilty people fidget more and we
can measure this.”","“The polygraph has been around since the 1920s
and, by measuring physiological stress induced by
anxiety, you can get to 60. However, it can easily be
abused as an interrogation prop and many people
are anxious anyway facing a polygraph on which
their job or liberty depends.”"
"In movies, the polygraph is always correct but, in
1998, the US Supreme Court decided that there
was no agreement that the polygraph was reliable.
The US National Academy of Scientists said the
same thing in 2003.","Anderson added that the research had a special
significance at this time because of a recent US
Senate report on torture by the CIA. There are
problems with torture from a moral point of view but
it is also a very unreliable way of getting accurate
information. “We have known for a long time that
torture does not work,” Anderson said. The new
method offers a good alternative to interviews.","He said the new method, by contrast, achieved a
reliability rating of over 70% and he was confident
they would be able to do better. In some tests, the
team has already achieved more than 80%."
"The tests Anderson and his colleagues did
involved 180 students and employees at Lancaster
University. Half of the people were told to tell the
truth and half to lie.","The research paper was written by Dr Sophie van
der Zee of Cambridge University, Professor Ronald
Poppe of Utrecht University, Professor Paul Taylor
of Lancaster University and Anderson.","Anderson said: “The takeaway message is that
guilty people fidget more and we can measure
this robustly.”"
"The researchers interviewed some of the people
about a computer game called Never End that they
played for seven minutes. Others lied about
playing it.","The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman
John Larson. It records changes in pulse, blood
pressure, sweating and breathing to find out
whether someone is lying.","Anderson added that the research had a special
significance at this time, against the background of
the US Senate report on torture by the CIA. Apart
from the moral case against torture, Anderson
pointed out that it was a very unreliable way of
gathering accurate information. “We have known
for a long time that torture does not work,” he said.
The new method offers a pragmatic, scientifically
backed alternative to conducting interviews."
"The second test involved a lost wallet with £5
inside. Some people had to bring the wallet to a
lost-and-found box. Others hid it and lied about it.","In movies, the polygraph is always right, But, in
1998, the US Supreme Court ruled that there was
no consensus that the polygraph was reliable.
This conclusion was supported by the US National
Academy of Scientists in 2003.","The research paper was written by Dr Sophie van
der Zee of Cambridge University, Professor Ronald
Poppe of Utrecht University, Professor Paul Taylor
of Lancaster University and Anderson."
"The new body-suit method was correct 82.2% of
the time. Researchers monitored how much the
people moved their arms and legs, to decide if they
were telling the truth or lying.","The experiment carried out by Anderson and his
colleagues involved 180 students and employees
at Lancaster University – half of the people were
told to tell the truth and half to lie. They were each
paid £7.50 for their participation in the 70-minute
experiment, involving two tests.","The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman
John Larson, based on research by the
psychologist William Marston. It records changes
in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to
ascertain whether a subject is lying."
"All-body suits are expensive – they cost about
£30,000 – and they can be uncomfortable, so
Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at
cheaper alternatives. These include using
motion-sensing technology from computer games,
such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft
for the Xbox console.","Some were interviewed about a computer game
Never End, which they played for seven minutes.
Others lied about playing the game – they had only
seen notes about it.","While cinema depictions suggest the device is
near-infallible, the US Supreme Court ruled,
in 1998, that there was no consensus that the
polygraph was reliable, a finding supported by the
US National Academy of Scientists in 2003."
,"The second test involved a lost wallet containing
£5. Some were asked to bring the wallet to a
lost-and-found box. Others hid it and lied about it.","The experiment carried out by Anderson and his

involving two tests."
,"“Overall, we correctly guessed whether 82.2%
(truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees were
telling the truth or lying based on the movements in
their individual limbs,” the report says.","Some were interviewed about a computer game
Never End, which they played for seven minutes,
while others lied about playing it, having only been
shown notes about it."
,"Anderson said: “First, we looked at how much
different body parts showed that someone was
lying. We found that liars wave their arms more, but
this is only at the 60% level that you can get from
a polygraph.","The second test involved a lost wallet containing
£5. Some were asked to bring the wallet to a
lost-and-found box while others hid it and lied
about it."
,"“The success came when we looked at total body
motion. That tells truth from lies over 70% of the time
and we believe we can improve it even more by
combining it with optimal questioning techniques.”","“Overall, we correctly classified 82.2% (truths:
88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees as either
being truthful or deceptive based on the combined
movement in their individual limbs,” the report says."
,"Another advantage is that total body motion is
mostly the same in people who have different
cultural backgrounds and different levels of
anxiety – these things confuse other lie-detection
technologies, Anderson said.","Anderson said: “Our first attempt looked at the
extent to which different body parts and body
signals indicated deception. It turned out that liars
wave their arms more but, again, this is only at the 60% level that you can get from a
conventional polygraph."
,"The use of all-body suits is expensive – they cost
about £30,000 – and they can be uncomfortable,
so Anderson and his colleagues are now studying
low-cost alternatives. These include using motion-sensing technology from computer games,
such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft
for the Xbox.","“The pay dirt was when we considered total body
motion. That turns out to tell truth from lies over
70% of the time and we believe it can be improved
still further by combining it with optimal
questioning techniques.”"
,"Anderson admits that intelligence agencies such as
the CIA could teach agents how to trick the full-body
motion method by keeping their bodies completely
still. But he said that in itself would be a giveaway.","Another advantage is that total body motion is
relatively unaffected by cultural background, anxiety
and cognitive load (how much you are thinking),
which confound other lie-detection technologies,
Anderson said."
