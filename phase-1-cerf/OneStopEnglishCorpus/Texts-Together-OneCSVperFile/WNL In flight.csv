"Passing clouds
One of the good things about flying is seeing
clouds very close. They seem to be light, but
they carry a lot of water – around 500 tonnes in a
small cloud. And water is heavier than air. So why
don’t clouds fall out of the sky like rain? They do,
but they take a very long time. An average cloud
would take a year to fall one metre.","Passing clouds

"On cloud nine
Most of us are happy to call clouds “fluffy ones”
or “nasty black ones”, but there are more than
50 cloud types. The 50 cloud types fit into
nine categories. Cloud nine is the very big
cumulonimbus, so to be “on cloud nine” means
that you are on top of the world or very, very happy.","On cloud nine

"Around the rainbow
The best place to see a rainbow is from a plane.
Rainbows are made when sunlight hits raindrops.
We see a bow because the Earth is in the way,
but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle.","Around the rainbow

"Mr blue sky
Sunlight is white. It includes all the colours of the
spectrum. As it passes through air, some of the
light is scattered. Blue light scatters more than
other colours, so the blue looks like it comes from
the sky.","Mr blue sky

"There’s life out there
We usually only see clouds and other planes
from a flying aircraft’s window, but the air is full of
bacteria – 1,800 different types of bacteria.","There’s life out there
Apart from clouds and other planes, we don’t
expect to see much directly outside a flying
aircraft’s window, but the air is full of bacterial life –
as many as 1,800 different types of bacteria have
been detected over cities and they can reach twice
the cruising height of a plane.","There’s life out there

"Turbulence terror
Even someone who flies all the time can feel sick
because of turbulence. The good news is that
no modern airliner has ever crashed because
of these sudden and violent movements of
air. People have been hurt when they are not
strapped in or falling luggage may hit them – but
the plane is not going to fall out of the sky.","Turbulence terror
Turbulence can make even the most experienced
flyer turn green. The violent movements of air can
cause anything from repeated bumping to sudden,
dramatic plunges. The good news for nervous
flyers is that no modern airliner has ever been
brought down by turbulence. People have been
injured and occasionally killed when they are not
strapped in, or get hit by falling luggage – but the
plane is not going to fall out of the sky.","Turbulence terror

"You can’t cure jet lag
The world is divided into time zones. When you
take a long flight, the difference between local
time and your body’s time causes jet lag. But jet
lag can be reduced if you keep food bland for 24
hours before travel, drink a lot and live on your
destination time from the moment you get on
the aircraft.","In-flight radiation
When body scanners were introduced at airports,
there were radiation scares, but the level produced
by the scanners is the same as passengers
receive in one minute of flight. The Earth is
constantly hit by cosmic rays, natural radiation
from space that is stronger at altitude.","In-flight radiation

"Supersonic 747s
Many of us have travelled faster than sound.
There are many jet streams in the air around the
Earth, especially on the journey from the US to
Europe. A jet stream can move as fast as 250
miles per hour. If an airliner flying at 550mph
enters a jet stream, the result can be that the
plane flies at 800mph. That’s faster than the
speed of sound.","You can’t cure jet lag
The world is divided into time zones. The result is
that long-haul travel results in a difference between
local time and your body’s time, causing jet lag.
However, its effects can be reduced by keeping
food bland for 24 hours before travel, drinking
plenty of fluids and living on your destination time
from the moment you reach the aircraft.","You can’t cure jet lag

"Flying through time
Flying across time zones means that we travel
through time. But this time travel is so small that
crossing the Atlantic every week for 40 years
would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into
the future.","Supersonic 747s
Many of us have travelled faster than sound.
There are a number of jet streams in the upper
atmosphere, especially on the journey from the US
to Europe, where a temperature inversion causes
a stream of air to move as fast as 250 miles per
hour. If an airliner with an airspeed of 550mph
enters a jet stream, the result can be that it flies at
800mph, faster than the speed of sound.","Supersonic 747s

"Terrible tea
Don’t blame the cabin attendant if your tea
isn’t great. Water should be just under 100°C
when you pour it on to tea leaves – but that isn’t
possible on a plane. It’s impossible to get water
hotter than 90°C during flight – so choose coffee.","Flying through time
Time zones provide an artificial journey through
time – but special relativity means that a flight
involves actual time travel. However, it’s so
minimal that crossing the Atlantic weekly for 40
years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second
into the future.","Flying through time

"I can’t hear my food
People often say that airline food is bland and
without taste. But some of the problem may not
be bad food. A plane is a noisy place and food
loses some of its taste when there are
loud noises.","Terrible tea

"Needle in a haystack
With modern technology, it seems strange that
Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear – but
finding a missing aircraft is a needle-in-ahaystack
problem. The plane knows where it is
but it does not send this information anywhere.
The problem is not technology – the problem is
that there is no law that says that planes must
send this information.","I can’t hear my food

"Volcanic fallout
Air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity.
Ash melts in the heat of the engine, then solidifies
on the rotors. It is very dangerous to ignore the
volcanic ash.","Needle in a haystack

the 1980s – the problem is not technology but that
there is no law saying that it is required.","Needle in a haystack

Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear without a
trace – yet, finding a missing aircraft is a needlein-

location, both from GPS and inertial tracking, but this information is not relayed elsewhere in real
time. That would be perfectly possible. Oceangoing
ships have had tracking since the 1980s
– the limitation is not technology but a lack of
legislation requiring it."
"The wing myth
For many years, we taught the wrong explanation
for the way wings keep planes in the air. But now
we know that a plane stays in the air because of
Newton’s Third Law of Motion. The shape of the
wing pushes air down. As the air is pushed down,
the wing gets an equal and opposite push up,
and this lifts the plane.","Volcanic fallout
Air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity.
Glass-like ash particles melt in the heat of the
engine, then solidify on the rotors. Cancelling all
flights in an ash cloud may be inconvenient – but
the risks of ignoring the ash are clear.","Volcanic fallout

,,"Forget electric planes
When we see ultra-light, experimental, electric
planes, it’s easy to assume there will soon be
clean, green, electric airliners, but it won’t happen
any time soon. Aircraft fuel packs in a remarkable
amount of energy. Batteries are much less
efficient. To provide the same energy as a tonne
of fuel would take 100 tonnes of batteries – and
a 747 uses 150 to 200 tonnes of fuel. Unless
battery technology is made vastly more efficient,
electric airliners won’t get off the ground."
,,"Beware the vortex
Pilots often wait a long time to get clearance.
This is to allow the air to settle after a previous
take-off, as a plane’s wingtips generate vortices
in the air, which can take two or three minutes
to disperse. If the following aircraft set off
immediately, the rapidly moving air would make
the plane difficult to handle. The delay gives the
air time to recover from the miniature whirlwinds
caused by the preceding plane."
,,"The doors aren’t locked
In practice, the doors on a plane don’t need to
be locked. If you watch an aircraft door being
opened, it swings in an unusual way. It first has
to be opened inwards before manoeuvring it
out of the way. Once the plane has taken off, a
significant pressure difference soon builds up
between the inside of the plane and the outside.
This differential forces the door into place. To
open it, you would have to pull against the air
pressure, well beyond the capabilities of
human muscles."
