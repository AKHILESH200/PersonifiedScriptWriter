"James Bond films are one of the world’s oldest and
most successful film series. Twenty-three Bond
films have been made so far. They have earned
more than $6 billion at cinemas around the world.
James Bond is not slowing down. In fact, the films
are more popular than ever – Skyfall, which broke
all records and became the biggest ever film at UK
cinemas in 2012, earned a total of $1.1 billion.","James Bond films are one of the world’s longest
running and most successful film series, with 23
movies and more than $6bn earned at box offices
around the world. But James Bond shows no signs
of slowing down. In fact, Bond is more popular
than ever, after the record-breaking performance of
Skyfall, which became the biggest ever film at the
UK box office in 2012, earning a total of $1.1bn.","He is the star of one of the world’s longest running

more than $6bn amassed at the global box office,
but James Bond shows no signs of slowing down.
In fact, the Bond brand is stronger than ever, after
the record-breaking performance of Skyfall, which
became the biggest ever film at the UK box office
on its release in 2012 and, with its total earnings of
$1.1bn, currently stands in ninth place of all-time
largest earners."
"So, there was a lot of interest when they announced
more details about the 24th Bond film – especially
its title, Spectre. The number one question is: can
Spectre be as successful as Skyfall?","For this reason, there was a lot of interest
surrounding the announcement of a few more
details about the 24th Bond film – especially its
official title, Spectre. The number one question is:
can Spectre repeat Skyfall’s success?","Hence the intense interest that surrounded the
announcement of a few more details of the 24th
Bond film – not the least its official title, Spectre.
The number one question is this: can Spectre
repeat the Skyfall trick? Will Skyfall remain a high
water mark for the Bond movie or can Spectre
extend this winning run?"
"Charles Gant, film editor for Heat magazine, thinks
it can. “They were very clever when they made
Skyfall,” he says. “It was both modern and retro.
Daniel Craig fans liked it and, also, older, more
nostalgic Bond fans, who lost interest over the
previous few films. With the new title,” he adds, “it is
certain to be a success.”","Charles Gant, film editor for Heat magazine,
says it is heading in the right direction. “Skyfall
was a brilliant strategic move,” he says. “It was
simultaneously modern and retro. It appealed
to fans of Daniel Craig and it also engaged the
older, more nostalgic Bond fans, who may have
lost interest over the previous few films. With the
new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”","Charles Gant, film editor for Heat magazine, says
the indications are it is heading in the right direction.
“Skyfall was a brilliant strategic move,” he says. “It
was cleverly positioned as simultaneously modern
and retro. It appealed to the Daniel-Craig-era fans,
who are relative newcomers to the franchise, and it
also managed to engage the older, more nostalgic
elements of the audience, who may have lost
interest over the previous few films. With the new
title,” he adds, “they are already on to a winner. My
feeling is that Spectre announces that they want to
hang on to the nostalgic, more age-diverse Bond
fan, as well as retaining the younger audience.”"
"Eon Productions is the company, started in 1961,
that made Dr No and all the “official” Bond films.
The company really wants the next film to be
successful so it is using the same people that
worked on Skyfall in the new film. Daniel Craig will
play Bond and the same people have written the
script. Most importantly, Sam Mendes will again be
the director. According to Gant, Mendes is the best
Bond director. Gant says: “Mendes attracted top
actors like Ralph Fiennes. Actors like Fiennes will
only be in a film if they like the director.”","It seems that Eon Productions, the company
originally founded in 1961 to make Dr No and that
is behind all the “official” Bonds, is doing all it can
to ensure another success – they are installing
the key creative talent behind Skyfall on Spectre.
Daniel Craig will play Bond at least until film 25
and the same writers have produced the script.","The initial signs are that Eon Productions, the
company originally founded in 1961 to make Dr No
and that is behind all the “official” Bonds, is doing its
utmost to ensure lightning strikes twice by installing
the key creative talent behind Skyfall on Spectre.
Daniel Craig has been tied down at least until Bond
25, while the same writers have produced the script."
"The Bond series was not in trouble before the
arrival of Mendes – and Craig – but the films were
becoming a bit boring towards the end of Pierce
Brosnan’s time as Bond. There were no longer any
more original Bond stories to adapt and the films no
longer had enough energy.","But it’s getting Sam Mendes as director again that
gives Bond fans the most hope. A director mainly
known for character studies such as American
Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes has taken
the Bond series to new heights. Gant says: “Mendes
managed to engage with both the modern and the
traditional Bond audience, and he also attracted top
actors like Ralph Fiennes. Actors like Fiennes will
only agree to be in a film if they like the director.”","But it’s the recapture of director Sam Mendes that
gives Bondwatchers the most hope. A director
principally known for character studies such as
American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes
has taken the Bond series to new heights. Gant
says: “Mendes managed to engage with both the
modern and the traditional Bond audience, and he
also pulled in high-calibre actors like Ralph Fiennes.
To get actors like Fiennes in, they have to be happy
with the director.”"
"This was nothing new: the history of the Bond
series has been one of constant change, especially
of the lead actor: first, Sean Connery; then, George
Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Brosnan
and, now, Craig. Each new actor has been different
and some have been better than others.","Though the Bond series was not in trouble before
Mendes’s arrival – and Craig’s – there was a certain
amount of staleness towards the end of Pierce
Brosnan’s time as Bond. The series had survived
the drying up of original Bond stories to adapt, and
the movies were no longer anything like the Ian
Fleming originals, but they were lacking dynamism.","Among other achievements, Skyfall virtually
doubled the box office of its predecessor, Quantum of
Solace, which managed a worldwide figure of $586m
on its release in 2008. No one is expecting anything
like that this time, but Eon will not be complacent."
"Lazenby only did one Bond film. Dalton’s two
films, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill,
were during a period in the late 80s when more
aggressive Hollywood action movies were more
popular. According to Gant, “the period of Roger
Moore’s last films and Dalton’s films didn’t excite
audiences. Brosnan was more successful but Craig
is the best. On the other hand, the early Bond films
were sexy and exciting.”","This cycle, however, was nothing new: the history
of the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow,
revolving most obviously around the lead actor:
first, Sean Connery; then, successively, George
Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Brosnan
and, now, Craig. Each new Bond has been a
response to the state of the series, and some have
been more successful than others.","Though the Bond series was not in trouble before
Mendes’s arrival – and Craig’s – there was the
sense of a certain amount of staleness towards
the end of Pierce Brosnan’s run. The series had
survived the drying up of actual Bond stories to
adapt, the movies having long since departed from
any resemblance to the Ian Fleming originals, but it
was lacking a certain dynamism."
"Skyfall made more money than all the other Bond
films. But some of the 1960s Bond films were
almost as successful. With figures adjusted for
inflation, the 1965 film Thunderball is only a little bit
below Skyfall. And Goldfinger and You Only Live
Twice both did better than the other Craig films.
Licence to Kill made the least money of all Bond
films and Moore’s final film, A View to a Kill, the
second least.","Lazenby only lasted a single film and Dalton’s two
efforts, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill,
were during a period in the late 80s when the 007
movie was eclipsed by more aggressive, slick
Hollywood action movies. According to Gant, “the
period of Roger Moore’s last films, and the Dalton
period, didn’t really excite audiences. Brosnan was
more successful commercially, but Craig has taken
Bond to new levels. On the other hand, the early
Bonds were incredibly commercial films, sexy and
exciting, and there was very little like them.”","This cycle, however, was nothing new: the history
of the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow,
stasis and renewal, revolving most obviously
around the lead actor: first, Sean Connery; then,
successively, George Lazenby, Roger Moore,
Timothy Dalton, Brosnan and, now, Craig. Each
appointment has been a response to the state of the
series and some have worked out better than others."
"Martin Campbell is an experienced British director
and he planned one of the most elaborate stunts
in Bond history. In the famous first scene of
Goldeneye (released in 1995), Bond falls into a
light aeroplane without a pilot. This scene helped to
make the Bond series more modern and popular.
Also, a very successful Goldeneye video game
created new, younger fans of Bond and made
people think that the Bond film was no longer boring
and old-fashioned.","Skyfall made more money than all the other Bond
films. However, the performance of some of the
1960s films was almost as brilliant by comparison. If
you adjust the figures for inflation, the 1965 release,
Thunderball, is only just below Skyfall, while
Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice both did better
than the other Craig films (and the 70s Bonds,
The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die, did
better, too). By this calculation, Licence to Kill is the
worst-performing of all Bonds, with Moore’s final
film, A View to a Kill, the second least successful.","Lazenby only lasted a single film, while Dalton’s
two efforts, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill
coincided with a period in the late 80s when the
007 movie had been thoroughly eclipsed by more
aggressive, slickly produced Hollywood action
movies. According to Gant, “the period of Roger
Moore’s last ones, going into Dalton, didn’t really
excite audiences. Brosnan saw a bit of an upturn
commercially, while Craig has taken it to new levels.
On the other hand, the early Bonds were incredibly
commercial films, sexy and exciting, and there was
very little around like them.”"
,"Nevertheless, the Bond brand has remained very
powerful over the years and Eon has had to fight
off attempts by rival companies to capitalize on the
popularity of the series. Through a quirk of rights
ownership, adaptations of Casino Royale (in 1967)
and Thunderball (as Never Say Never Again,
in 1983) were released in competition with Eon
productions. After legal disputes that continued for
many years, Eon now has full control of both books.","It’s a point worth underlining that, although Skyfall’s
actual receipts dwarf all the other Bond films, the
performance of some of the 1960s entries in the
series was almost as brilliant by comparison. With
figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 release,
Thunderball, is only a hair’s breadth below Skyfall,
while Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice both
outperformed the other Craig films (as did the 70s
Bonds, The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let
Die). By this reckoning, Licence to Kill is the
worst-performing of all Bonds, with Moore’s final
effort, A View to a Kill, in second-to-last place."
,"Martin Campbell was another experienced British
director and he was able to plan one of the most
elaborate stunts in Bond history. In the famous
opening scene of Goldeneye (released in 1995),
Bond freefalls into a pilotless light aeroplane. This
scene really helped modernize the series and
increase its popularity. Moreover, a whole new
generation was reached through a hugely successful
Goldeneye video-game spin-off, which made a
significant contribution to perceptions that the Bond
film was no longer stale and old-fashioned.","Nevertheless, the Bond brand has remained
immensely powerful over the decades, with Eon
being forced to fend off attempts by rival outfits to
capitalize on the series’s popularity. Through a quirk
of rights ownership, adaptations of Casino Royale
(in 1967) and Thunderball (as Never Say Never
Again, in 1983) were released in competition with
Eon productions. Although subject to legal disputes
over several decades, Eon now has full control of
both books."
,,"Casino Royale, whose rights had been individually
sold off by Fleming in 1955, eventually passed to
Eon in 1999 as a result of an agreement between
Eon’s backers, MGM, and rival Hollywood studio
Sony – thereby clearing the way for the 2006
version. Thunderball, on the other hand, owed its
disputed status to writer-producer Kevin McClory,
who helped Fleming outline the original story
and who claimed ownership of the novel over
subsequent decades, and produced Never Say
Never Again as a result. After McClory’s death in
2006, his family eventually settled with MGM and
Eon’s parent company in November 2013."
,,"If the initial surge of enthusiasm for Bond movies
lasted through the 60s and into the 1970s, it’s fair
to say that the series almost ground to a halt after
Licence to Kill’s poor figures. Goldeneye, the first of
Brosnan’s efforts, heralded a dramatic renewal: not
simply because of a new actor but, more significantly,
because of who was behind the camera."
,,"However, after a six-year break, Eon installed
Martin Campbell in the chair: another experienced
British director but one who was able to orchestrate
one of the most elaborate stunts in Bond history.
The justly renowned opening scene of Goldeneye
– during which Bond freefalls into the cockpit of a
pilotless light aeroplane – did much to reinvigorate
and modernize the series on its own. Moreover,
a whole new generation was reached through a
hugely successful Goldeneye video-game spin-off,
making a significant contribution to perceptions that
the Bond film was no longer stale and
old-fashioned."
