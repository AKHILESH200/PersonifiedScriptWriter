"There are many quirky solutions to help make our cities better places to live, such as glow-in-the-dark trees, underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins.City living is good in many ways but it is not always possible to lead a sustainable lifestyle in a city. Pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily problems that people in cities have to live with.We look at ten quirky solutions that could make our cities better places to live.","There are many quirky solutions to help make our cities more livable, such as glow-in-the-dark trees, underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins.City living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is not always one of them.

"Pop-up parksToday’s cities sometimes look like they’re built for cars and not for people. The pop-up park is a simple idea. You need an empty car park, a small amount of money and a plant or two, and you can make your own private park. The PARK(ing) project started as an arts experiment in San Francisco. It has since spread across the world.","Pop-up parksToday’s cities sometimes look like they’re built more for cars than people. The pop-up park is a simple idea.

"Underground storageNot everyone in a city has a car. Bikes are in fashion but there is one problem: where to keep the bike safe? An engineering company in Tokyo has a solution: an underground bicycle park. Just seven metres wide, the bicycle park goes deep enough into the ground to keep 204 bikes.","Subterranean storageNot all urban dwellers have cars. Bikes are becoming more and more fashionable. The question is: where to keep them safe? Tokyo-based engineering company Giken has a solution: an underground bicycle park. Just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep into the ground and can hold 204 bikes. Owners can retrieve their bike at the touch of a button – the automated system delivers it back above ground in around 13 seconds.","Subterranean storageNot all urban dwellers are hooked to the car. Bikes are ever more in vogue. The question is: where to keep it safe? Tokyo-based engineering  rm Giken has come up with a concept for a solution: an “eco- cycle, anti-seismic underground bicycle park”. At just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep enough into the ground to house 204 bikes. Owners can retrieve their bike at the touchof a button, with the automated system delivering it back above ground in around 13 seconds."
"Glow-in-the-dark treesWhen most people think of trees that glow in the dark, they usually think of Christmas trees. Not Daan Roosegaarde. The Dutch designer-artist has invented a plant that is like a light. The technology joins DNA from glowing marine bacteria with a plant to create a glow like a jelly sh. Roosegaarde hopes that this technology could one day replace normal street lighting.","Glow-in-the-dark treesWhen most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas trees usually come to mind. Not Daan Roosegaarde. The Dutch designer-artist has invented a “bioluminescent” plant. The experimental technology joins DNA from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a glow like a jelly sh. They are trying to create a version of the technology that Roosegaarde hopes could one day replace normal street lighting.","Glow-in-the-dark treesWhen most people think of trees that glow in the dark, Christmas baubles and fallen pine needles usually come to mind. Not Daan Roosegaarde.The Dutch designer-artist has comes up with a “bioluminescent” plant. The experimental technology splices DNA from luminescent marine bacteriawith the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a jelly sh-type glow. Trials are underway to create an industrial-scale version of the biomimicry-inspired technology that Roosegaarde hopes could one day replace conventional street lighting."
"Pedestrian electricityEvery day, hundreds of people in the east London neighbourhood of West Ham cross a pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. They probably don’t notice the springiness of the walkway. And they probably don’t know that the springy rubber surface powers the streetlights above. The  oorhas tiles that capture the energy from pedestrians’ footsteps and turn it into electricity. There is a similar system at London’s Heathrow Airport.","Footfall harvestingEvery day, hundreds of commuters and shoppers in the east London neighbourhood of West Ham cross the elevated pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. Few people probably notice the springiness beneath their feet. Even fewer realize that the springy rubber surface powers the streetlights above. The  oor has smart tiles that capture the energy from pedestrians’ footsteps and convert it into electricity. Pavegen, the UK company who had the idea, has installed a similar systemat London’s Heathrow Airport and other international locations.","Footfall harvestingEvery day, hundreds of commuters and shoppers in the east London neighbourhood of West Ham cross the elevated pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. Few probably notice the springiness beneath their feet. Fewer still connect that  ve-millimetre  ex in the rubber surface tothe powering of the streetlights above. The paved  ooring is decked with smart tiles that capturethe kinetic energy from pedestrians’ footstepsand convert it into electricity.

"SupertreesSingapore’s Gardens by the Bay has a group of man-made trees. Up to 50 metres high, these steel ‘supertrees’ have  owers growing up them. They collect rainwater and 11 of the 18 trees also have solar panels on their ‘branches’.","SupertreesIt had to happen eventually: man-made trees. Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay has a group of them. Up to 50 metres high, these steel-framed ‘supertrees’ not only have  owers growing up them– their metallic canopies absorb and disperse heat, too. And they collect rainwater, as well as provide air ventilation for two large conservatories below. Eleven of the 18 trees also have solar panels ontheir ‘branches’.","SupertreesIt had to happen eventually: man-made trees. Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay has a small copse of them. Up to 50 metres high, thesesteel-framed ‘supertrees’ not only have  owers and ferns growing up them but their metallic canopies act to absorb and disperse heat too. They’re equipped to harvest rainwater, too, as well as provide air ventilation for two “climate-controlled biomes”(large conservatories, in other words) below.Eleven of the 18 trees also boast solar panels along their ‘branches’."
