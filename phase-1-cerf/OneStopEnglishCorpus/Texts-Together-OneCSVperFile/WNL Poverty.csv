"A new report says that almost one billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 if countries don’t try to solve the social, economic and cultural problems that keep them poor. The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, but fall back again when they have problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict.","A new report has warned that up to a billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 unless countries confront the social, economic and cultural forces that keep them in poverty.

The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network (CPAN) asserts that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, only to tumble back when they are hit by a combination or sequence of shocks such as drought, illness and insecurity or con ict."
"The report found that, in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again. This percentage rose to 60% in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion was 20%.","The report found that, in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again, rising to 60% in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009.

"Individual examples show how easy it isfor people to fall back into poverty. Amin is from a village in Bangladesh. His income has fallen slowly, because of his illnessand his wife’s illness, the cost of his son’s marriage, the death of his father and lossof goods such as  shing nets. Lovemore, from Zimbabwe, is now one of the poorest people in his village. He recently lost his job because of ill health and has to look after his  ve grandchildren after the death ofhis daughters.","Individual examples show how easy it is for people to slip back into poverty.

"“We need to make sure that people who come out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. Too many families return to poverty when they have personal or bigger problems. Governments shouldn’t assume that, just because somebody’s income hits $1.25, that means the problem is solved,” said Andrew Shepherd, the main author of the report.","“We need to ensure that people who are lifted out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. Too many families are slipping back into poverty because they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks. Governments shouldn’t assume that, just because somebody’s income reaches $1.25, that means job done,” said Andrew Shepherd, lead author of the report.","“We need to ensure that people lifted outof poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. Too many families are experiencing ‘two steps forward, one step back’, where they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks. Governments shouldn’t assume that, just because somebody’s income hits $1.25,that means job done,” said Andrew Shepherd, research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, a partner of CPAN, and lead author of the report."
"According to the UN, the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is still possible. But the report says that countries need to make changes to achieve zero poverty. There was a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9 billionin 1990 to 1.2 billion in 2010, but the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much more dif cult. There has been a lot of progress in China but there will probably not be similar progress in other parts of the world.","A UN high-level panel said it was possibleto achieve the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030. The report, however, argues that “more of the same” will not get to zero. Despite a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9bn in 1990 to 1.2bn in 2010, the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much harder. The big gains in China are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere, while climate-related shocks and deep poverty in parts of sub-Saharan Africa will slow down progress.","A UN high-level panel considering a new development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals after 2015 said the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 was within reach. The report, however, argues that “more of the same” will not get to zero."
"The report says countries should try to help the chronically poor – those who are poor for many years or their entire lives – and stop people becoming poor. “Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is quite easy. But they have avoided the more dif cult job of trying to reduce chronic poverty,”said Shepherd.","The report says the focus should be onthe chronically poor – those who are poorfor many years or their entire lives – andon stopping the descent into poverty. “Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy. But they have shied away from the more dif cult job of trying to solve chronic poverty,” said Shepherd.","Despite a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9bnin 1990 to 1.2bn in 2010, the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much harder.

"The report says progress on poverty reduction has helped people who were already closer to the poverty line, but has helped the chronically poor much less. It will not be possible to get to zero poverty if development policies don’t focus on the chronically poor, it adds. The report suggests three ideas. They all cost a lot of money.","The report says progress on poverty reduction has had less of an impacton the chronically poor than on thosewho were already closer to the poverty line. It will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies focus onthe chronically poor, it adds. The report suggests three policies, all of which require massive global investment.","The report calls for a shift in thinking about poverty to focus on the chronically poor – those who are poor for many years or their entirelives – and for more emphasis on stopping impoverishment, the descent into poverty. “Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy – there is a tendency to pick the low-hanging fruit, but they have shied away from the more dif cult job of tackling chronic poverty,” said Shepherd."
"The  rst is social help – to bring the poorest people closer to a good-enough standard of living. The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, so people can escape and stay out of poverty. The third is economic growth policies that make sure that the bene ts of increasing national wealth reach the poorest people.","The  rst is social assistance – to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living. The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty. The third is economic growth policies that ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the verypoorest people.","The report says progress on poverty reduction, while impressive to date, has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line. It will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies prioritize those living in chronic poverty, it adds. Policymakers must aim for a “zero tripod” of separate but interdependent objectives: tackle chronic poverty; stop impoverishment; sustain poverty escapes. They put forward a trio of policies, all of which require massiveglobal investment."
"All this will cost money and the report says higher taxes will be necessary. Aid willalso be necessary for the start-up costs for social assistance, healthcare for everyone and to  nance education. “There remainsa huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person,” Shepherd said.","All this will cost money and the report says one obvious implication is that countrieswill need greater tax revenues. Aid will also be needed for the start-up costs for social assistance, universal health coverage and to  nance education, including scholarships for the poorest children. “There remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person,” Shepherd said.","The  rst is social assistance – a safety net – to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living. An example of such a scheme is Ethiopia’s productive safety net programme that allowed thousands of vulnerable households to withstand drought without having to curtail education spending. The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty. Education also has the advantage of beinga “portable” asset. The third is pro-poorest economic growth policies to ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people."
"The authors say governments should havea national development plan and makesure the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social customs, such as dowries and witchcraft, that make extreme poverty worse.","With the current crises in Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, the report says it is essential that governments try to reduce the risk of con ict and to create peace.","“Economic growth really is critical, but notjust any old growth,” Shepherd said. “It has to generate not just employment but decent jobs, not just insecure low-paying jobs. There are ways of doing this, like India’s rural employmentguarantees scheme, which has boosted urban not just rural wages.” Another example cited by the report is South Africa’s extension of the minimum wage to groups such as domestic workers."
,"The report also argues that, if the inequalities which affect the poorest people – such as access to land, labour markets and the power relationships between menand women – are addressed, this would tackle two goals at the same time: reducing chronic poverty and inequality.","All this will take money and the report says one obvious implication is that stronger domestictax systems and greater tax revenues will be required. Aid will also be needed for thestart-up costs for social assistance, universal health coverage and to  nance education, including scholarships for the poorest children. “There remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per capita,” Shepherd said."
,"The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure that the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social norms, such as dowries and witchcraft, that contribute to extreme poverty: “This often means challenging parts of the status quo.”","Against a backdrop of crises in Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic,con ict and environmental disasters have to be addressed, and the report says it is essential that governments work to reduce the risk of con ict and to establish inclusive peace settlements."
,,"Incorporating “reducing (income) inequality” asa post-2015 goal would steer the international agenda in the right direction, given that lessening or containing inequality speeds up the impactof economic growth on poverty reduction. The report argues that if the inequalities that affect the poorest people – such as access to land, labour markets and the power relationships between men and women – are addressed, this would tackle two goals at the same time: reducing chronic poverty and inequality."
,,"The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure the poorest people are represented politically as well as tackling dif cult social norms such as dowries and witchcraftthat contribute to extreme poverty: “This often means challenging and, perhaps, sweeping away aspects of the status quo and represents the most marked departure from ‘business as usual’.”"
