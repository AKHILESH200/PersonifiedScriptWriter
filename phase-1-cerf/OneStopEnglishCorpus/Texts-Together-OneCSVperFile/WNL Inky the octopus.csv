"An octopus has escaped from the National
Aquarium in New Zealand. It escaped from
its tank, slid down a 50-metre drainpipe and
disappeared into the sea. Inky – a common New
Zealand octopus – escaped after someone left
the lid of his tank open. Staff at the aquarium
believe that, in the middle of the night, when
there was no-one in the building, Inky climbed
down the side of the tank and travelled across
the floor.","An octopus has escaped from the National

"Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National
Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said:
“Octopuses are famous for their ability to escape.
I don’t think he was unhappy with us, or lonely,
because octopuses like to live alone. But, he
is such a curious boy. He would want to know
what’s happening on the outside. That’s his
personality.”","Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National

a common New Zealand octopus – made his

enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled

"One idea is that Inky crossed the aquarium floor
– a journey of three or four metres – and then,
he realized that freedom was very near so he
entered a drainpipe that led directly to the sea.
The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened
into Hawke’s Bay, on the east coast of New
Zealand’s North Island.","One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium

"It is also possible that Inky escaped through
an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led
under the floor to the drain. “When we came in
the next morning and his tank was empty, I was
really surprised,” said Yarrell, who has not started
looking for Inky. “The staff and I have been sad.
But then, this is Inky and he’s always been a bit
of a surprise octopus.”","It is also possible that Inky escaped by squeezing

"Reiss Jenkinson, a keeper at the National
Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky
was not stolen. “I understand octopus behaviour
very well,” he said. “I have seen octopuses on
boats escape through waste pumps. And, the
security here is too good for anyone to take Inky
and why would they?”","Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National

"Because octopuses have no bones, they can
fit into very small spaces and can squeeze
through gaps the size of coins. They are also
very intelligent and able to use tools. At the Island
Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington,
an octopus visited another tank every night to
steal crabs, then return to its own tank. Another
octopus at the centre, Ozymandias, broke a world
record for opening a jar.","Because octopuses have no bones, they are

"Inky was brought to the National Aquarium
several years ago by a local fisherman who found
him in a fishing pot. Yarrell said, “He lived on
the reef and fought with fish so he was quite ill.”
According to Yarrell, Inky – who is about the size
of a rugby ball – was an “unusually intelligent”
octopus. “He was very friendly and a popular
attraction here. We have another octopus,
Blotchy, but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had
the personality.”","Inky was brought to the National Aquarium

"The aquarium has no plans to increase security
as a result of the escape but the staff now know
“what octopuses can do” so they will be more
careful. The aquarium is not looking for another
octopus but, if a fisherman brought in another
octopus, the aquarium might take it. “You never
know,” said Yarrell. “There’s always a chance
Inky will come home to us.”","The aquarium has no plans to step up security as

it might accept it. “You never know,” said Yarrell.
“There’s always a chance Inky could come home

number of years ago by a local fisherman who

,,"The aquarium has no plans to step up security
as a result of the escape as Inky was a “oneoff”
but the staff are “increasingly aware of
what octopuses can actually do”. Although
the aquarium is not actively searching for a
replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in
another octopus, it might be willing to take it on.
“You never know,” said Yarrell. “There’s always a
chance Inky could come home to us.”"
