"Bits of bone and hair stick out from the droppings. “It ate a red deer,’’ says Myslajek. “I can tell you all about this wolf – what it eats, if it’s a male or female, its sexual habits, age, health and family connections.’’","Bits of bone and hair stick out from the black faeces. “It ate a red deer,’’ says Mys_ajek, the University of Warsaw biologist. “In my lab, I can tell you all about this wolf – not only its diet but its gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections.’’","Bits of bone and hair protrude from the precious black faeces. “It ate a red deer,’’ says the University of Warsaw biologist. “In my lab, I can tell you all about this wolf – not only its diet but its gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections.’’"
"DNA tests have shown that Polish wolves are travellers. “One wolf walked to the Netherlands, where it was hit by a car. They travel very far. They need space. The average territory of a Polish pack is 250 square kilometres,’’ said Mys_ajek.","DNA tests have shown that Polish wolves are travellers. “One wolf reached the Netherlands, where unfortunately it was hit by a car.

"The scientist says wolves can move up to 30 kilometres during a single hunt. “The pack that he is tracking is a strong group of eight or nine animals. “This year, we have recorded  ve cubs, two young wolves and two adults.","“Can we ever reintroduce wolves to Scotland?’’ asks student Alex Entwisle, 23, on a study trip to southern Poland from the UK. He and other animal science students have spent the day looking for droppings and paw prints in the Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians.","“Is there any prospect of our ever being able to reintroduce wolves to Scotland?’’ asks student Alex Entwisle, 23, on a  eld trip to southern Poland from his college in the UK.

"He is fascinated by these animals, who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when other types of dog decided on a much more comfortable life as pets.","“The similarity is that we have a lot of animals– 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 roe deer. In Poland, we also have too many wildboar – about 200,000 – and these are eating and destroying farmers’ cereal crops. Here, wolves are part of the solution,’’ he says.","“The similarity is that we have a lot of animals – 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 roe deer. In Poland, we also have a massive overpopulation of wild boar – about 200,000 – and these are ravaging farmers’ cereal crops. Here, wolves are part of the solution,’’ he says."
"Mys_ajek says only the need to save forestsand control the wild animal population can save Europe’s wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. “Natural predators balance the ecosystem. They reduce the number of herbivores, which allows trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.’’","The scientist says wolves can move up to 30 kilometres during a single hunt. “The Beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine animals. This year, we have recorded  ve cubs, two young wolves and two adults.","The scientist, who is a familiar face on Polish television, says wolves are exceptional animals that are capable of moving up to 30km during a single hunt. “The Beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine individuals. This year, we have recorded  ve cubs, two yearlings and two adults."
The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathian mountains became law in 1995 and in the whole of Poland in 1998. There are now wolf packs in nearly all the country’s major forests where the wolves exist together with humans.,"“We track them using motion cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow.

All pack members care for the young.’’","“We track them using motion-activated camerasin the forest and by following their prints in themud and snow. In each family group, only one pair reproduces, once a year. All pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion.’’"
The Polish government pays compensation to farmers when a wolf kills their farm animals. Mys_ajek tells farmers to put up electric fences. He also tells them to use two things that wolves  nd scary: strings of small red  ags (to keep wolves away from sheep) and the Tatra Mountain Sheepdog.,"Mys_ajek, the son of a shepherd, doesn’t understand wolves’ bad reputation. “Why did we have to have the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood, with its big bad wolf?’","Mys_ajek, the son of a shepherd, is puzzled by wolves’ bad reputation. “Why does one speak of a ‘lone-wolf gunman’? Why did we have to have Little Red Riding Hood?’"
"Poland didn’t have many big roads until recently and this has helped wolves. In 1989, when the communists left power, Poland had only one motorway. Big road projects began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and they now have to consider wild animals.","He is fascinated by these aloof animals who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable life as domestic dogs.","He is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs."
"The way people think about wolves has also changed. “For many years, hunting was a part of life in Poland. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland.”","Mys_ajek says only scienti c arguments – the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population – can save Europe’s wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. “Natural predators balance the ecosystem.

"Mys_ajek says that Polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe. Packs go into neighbouring countries – Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia – where there is still hunting.",The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathians became law in 1995 and in the whole of Poland in 1998. There are now wolf packs in nearly all the country’s major forests where the wolves coexist with humans.,"Shoot the deer? “It is only a partial solution,’’ he says. “In a diverse environment, you have the so-called ‘landscape of fear’, where herbivoresno longer spend all day grazing on the tender riverside grass. They move away, as a precaution, to avoid being trapped by a predator. This gives the vegetation a chance.’’"
"He says Poland’s new government doesn’t like wolves. “The Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, is a hunter. There are 120,000 hunters in Poland and they have a lot of in uence.","The Polish government pays compensation for farm animals killed by wolves. Mys_ajek advises farmers to put up electric fences.

There are now resident packs in virtually all the country’s major forests. The predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off, as they are in African safari parks."
“It’s not easy to defend wolves. You can’t say to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction. Most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans. They have a very strong sense of smell.’’,"Poland’s wolves have been helped by the country’s late infrastructure development. In 1989, whenthe communists left power, Poland had only one motorway.

,"Attitudes have also changed. “For many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland. From the 1950s, hunting wolves was encouraged by the authorities. They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a month’s salary. It was carnage.’’","The survival and mobility of Poland’s wolves has been helped by the country’s belated infrastructure development. In 1989, when the communists relinquished power, Poland had only one motorway. Major road projects – requiring wildlife impact studies – began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals."

,The 12 British animal science students leave the Polish Carpathians without seeing a wolf. Entwisle does not believe that Scotland will ever be able to match Poland’s success.,"“The hunters claim wolves are a pest and that there are 4,000 of them in Poland, which is a spurious  gure based on an unscienti c count.
