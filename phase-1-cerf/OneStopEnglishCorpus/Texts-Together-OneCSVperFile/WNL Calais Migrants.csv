"While they wait for an answer, France does not
give them any money or allow them to work. The
wait can take many months. The jungle camp
offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over
their heads. So, many people decide to live there
and not work illegally because then they will not
be allowed to stay in France.","France is already home to more than a quarter of

we need to build another school,” he says with
a grin.","But, while the applicants wait to hear if they can
