"Tea, baked beans on toast and fish and chips have
always been popular in Britain. But, things are
changing, according to data published recently in
the National Food Survey.","Tea, baked beans on toast and fish and chips have
long been part of the British food tradition. But, there
has been a change in tastes over the generations.
This has been clearly shown in data published
recently in the National Food Survey, which was set
up in 1940 by the government because of concerns
about health and access to food.","In homes and cafes across the country, a cup
of tea, baked beans on toast and fish and chips
have long played a key role in the British dining
experience. But, the extent of a change in
tastes over the generations has been captured
in a dataset published recently in the National
Food Survey, which was set up in 1940 by the
government after concerns about health and
access to food."
"Everyone knows that the British love tea but they
drink more than 50% less tea than in the 1970s –
68g of tea per person per week compared to only
25g. Britons are now drinking on average only eight
cups of tea a week – they drank 23 cups in 1974.
Tea is still the most popular hot drink in the UK but
people now spend more money on coffee.","Everyone knows the British love tea but
consumption has more than halved since the
1970s, falling from 68g of tea per person per
week to only 25g. Britons are now drinking on
average only eight cups of tea a week, down from
23 cups in 1974. And, while tea remains the most
popular hot drink in the UK, people now spend
more money on coffee.","Despite the apparent British love of tea,
consumption has more than halved since the
1970s, falling from 68g of tea per person per
week to only 25g. With a teabag or portion of
loose tea weighing around 3g, that means Britons
are drinking on average only eight cups of tea
a week today, down from 23 cups in 1974. And,
while tea remains the most drunk hot drink in the
UK, households now spend more on coffee."
"The data comes from 150,000 families who
took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000,
combined with information from 2000 to 2014. It
shows a move towards healthier food in recent
years – people have changed to low-calorie soft
drinks, from whole to skimmed milk and they eat
more fresh fruit. But, the amount of chips, pizza,
crisps and ready meals they eat each week has
increased a lot.","The data is from 150,000 households who took part

Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as part of its
“open data” scheme, is from 150,000 households

consumption of chips, pizza, crisps and ready
meals has soared."
"There has also been an enormous change from
white to brown bread. The survey also shows the
amount of bread people eat has fallen from 25 to 15
slices a week over the past forty years. The amount
of baked beans people eat has reduced by 20%.
But, there has been an increase in other types of
convenience food, particularly Italian dishes. Adults
in the UK now eat an average of 75g of pizza every
week compared with none in 1974. The amount
of pasta they eat has almost tripled over the same
period.","There has also been a dramatic shift from white to
brown bread but the figures suggest the amount
of bread people are eating has fallen from 25 to
15 slices a week over the past four decades. The
consumption of baked beans has dropped by a fifth

particularly Italian dishes. Adults in the UK now eat
an average of 75g of pizza every week compared
with none in 1974, while the consumption of pasta
has almost tripled over the same period.","There has also been a dramatic shift from white
to brown, wholemeal and other bread but the
figures suggest the amount people are eating

baked beans in sauce has dropped by a fifth

food, particularly Italian dishes. Adults in the
UK now eat an average of 75g of pizza every
week compared with none in 1974, while the

"Fresh potatoes are also becoming less popular
with a 67% decrease from 1974, when adults
ate around 188g every day. People eat more of
other vegetables such as cucumbers, courgettes,
aubergines and mushrooms. The amount of
takeaway food they eat has almost doubled since
1974, from 80g per person per week to 150g.
Around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is
meat, with kebabs (10g), chicken (7g), burgers (5g)
and “meat-based meals” (32g) particularly popular.","Fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential

"It seems that British people are now more careful
about what they eat – the amount of fruit has
increased by 50% since 1974. In 2014, UK adults
ate an average of 157g of fruit per day. Bananas
have been the most popular fruit in the UK since
1996 – adults ate 221g per adult per week in 2014,
much more than apples (131g) and oranges (48g).
Half of all soft drinks British people drink are now
low-calorie soft drinks. Britons also spend a smaller
percentage of their salaries on food today – 11%,
compared with 24% in 1974.","Some trends suggest that British people are

"The UK Environment Secretary, Elizabeth Truss,
said: “Food is the heart of our society. This data
shows what we were eating 40 years ago but,
also, how a change in culture has led to a food
revolution. People care more about where their
food comes from than before, we can order quality
food on the internet, fashionable restaurants give
us the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are
now as common as fish and chips.”","The UK Environment Secretary, Elizabeth Truss,

with questions about owning chickens and getting

somewhat belated end in the same year to asking
the “housewife” to fill out the questionnaire. Britons

today – 11%, compared with 24% in 1974."
"She added that this data can show us more than
what, where or how older generations ate. It can
also show us when our habits changed. The
National Food Survey can tell us a lot and help us
to predict new food trends. “I look forward to seeing
how we can use this data to learn more about our
past and grow our world-leading food and farming
industry in the future,” she said.","“By studying this data, we can look beyond what,
