"The US team put electronic brain devices on
two rats. The devices let the animals work
together on simple tasks to earn rewards,
such as a drink of water. In one important
demonstration of the technology, the
scientists used the internet to connect the
brains of two rats thousands of miles away
from each other. One in North Carolina,
USA, and the other in Natal, Brazil.","The US team fitted two rats with devices called

"The head of the research team was Miguel
Nicolelis, who has made devices that allow
paralyzed people to control computers
and robotic arms with their thoughts. The
researchers say their latest work could make
it possible to connect many brains to share
information. “These experiments showed
that we have created a direct communication
connection between brains,” Nicolelis said.

"The scientists have shown that rats can
share information and respond to that
information. The scientists do this by
electrically connecting the rats’ brains.","The scientists first demonstrated that rats
can share, and act on, each other’s sensory
information by electrically connecting their
brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach
the part of the brain that processes movement.","The scientists first demonstrated that rats

"They trained the rats to press a lever when
they saw a light above it. When they did
the task correctly, they got some water.
To test the animals’ ability to share brain
information, they put the rats in two separate
compartments. Only one compartment had a
light above the lever. When the rat pressed
the lever, an electronic version of its brain
activity was sent directly to the other rat’s
brain. In tests, the second rat responded
correctly to the first rat’s brain signals and
pressed the lever 70% of the time.","The rats were taught to press a lever when a

"Incredibly, the communication between the
rats was two-way. If the rat that received
the information failed the task, the first rat
did not get the reward of a drink. It then
seemed to change its behaviour to make
the task easier for its partner. In further
experiments, the rats worked together on
a task where they had to tell the difference
between narrow and wide openings using
their whiskers.","Incredibly, the communication between the

"In the final test, the scientists connected rats
on different continents and used the internet
to send their brain activity. “The animals
were on different continents, but they could
still communicate,” said Miguel Pais-Vieira,
the first author of the study. “This tells us
that we could create a network of animal
brains, with the animals in many
different locations.”","In the final test, the scientists connected rats

"Nicolelis said the team is now trying to find
ways of linking many animals’ brains at
once to solve more difficult tasks. “We do
not know what might happen when animals
begin interacting as part of a ‘brain-net’,”
he said. “In theory, you could imagine that
a combination of brains could find solutions
that individual brains cannot find alone.”","Nicolelis said the team is now working on ways

"Anders Sandberg, of Oxford University, said
the work was “very important” in helping to
understand how brains process information.
But the possible future uses of the
technology are much wider, said Sandberg.

and coordinating. Without that, although
we are very clever animals, we would not

"“I don’t think these experiments will create

difference between sharing information
through the senses and being able to plan.

"We know very little about how people

not happen any time soon. And much of
what is in our minds is what Sandberg calls
a “draft” of what we might do. “And we
