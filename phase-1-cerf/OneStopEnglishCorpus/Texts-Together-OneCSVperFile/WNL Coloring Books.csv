McLaughlin works for them. She says the craze
has happened because they are telling people
that the books will help them to relax. “The first
book we did was in 2012, Creative Colouring for
Grown-Ups. It sold well but it was in 2014 that
adult colouring books became really popular with
Art Therapy. We tell people they are anti-stress
books so people are allowed to enjoy something
they thought was childish before,” she said.","At independent UK publisher Michael O’Mara,

"“I think it is really relaxing to unplug,” said
Basford. “And it’s creative. For many people,
a blank sheet of paper is very daunting; with a
colouring book you just need to bring the colour.
Also, people do it because they feel nostalgia for
their childhoods. So many people have said to
me that they used to do secret colouring in when
their kids were in bed. Now, people don’t feel silly.
These are books for adults. The art in my books
is super intricate.” The illustrator, who lives in
Aberdeenshire, is creating a third book.","“I think it is really relaxing to unplug,” said
