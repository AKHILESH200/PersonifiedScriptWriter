"Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than we thought before. New research shows that underwater noise could stop these animals communicating andmake it more dif cult for them to  nd food. It is well known that noise from ships disturbs large whales. But, US researchers have found noise also disturbs smaller sea creatures such as killer whales, also known as orcas. Dolphins and porpoises may have the same problems.","Noise from ships may disturb animals suchas killer whales and dolphins much more than people previously thought. New research shows that underwater noise could disturb the animals’ communication and ability to  nd prey. The low rumble of passing ships has, for a long time, been connected to the disturbance of large whales. But, US researchers have also found noise at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20,000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best.","Noise emanating from passing ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins far more than previously thought, with new research showing that the animals’ communication and ability to  nd prey could be hampered by the underwater din. The low rumble of passing ships has long been connected to the disturbanceof large whales. But, US researchers have documented persistent noise also occurring at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20,000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best."
"“The main problem is that even a small increasein sound may make it more dif cult for whales to  nd food using echo,” said Scott Veirs, who led the research. “That’s worrying because their food, a kind of salmon, is already quite scarce. Hearing a salmon’s click is probably one of the most dif cult things a killer whale does. It is harder to hear that click if there’s a lot of noise around you.”","These noises could be disturbing the ability of killer whales to communicate and use echo to  nd their prey. Dolphins and porpoises, which also hear at higher frequencies, may have the same problems. The  ndings suggest that the noise could affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes up the west coast of the USA.","These noise disturbances could be hinderingthe ability of killer whales to communicate and echolocate – the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are. Dolphins and porpoises, which also operateat higher frequencies, may be suffering the same problems. The  ndings suggest that the noise could well affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes. A population of just 84 killer whales forage up the US west coast and into Puget Sound."
"The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise made by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA. The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of ship, including cruise ships, container ships and military ships, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.","“The main concern of this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales,” said Scott Veirs, who led the research. Echolocation is the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are. “That’s worrying because their prey, chinook salmon, is already quite scarce. Hearing a salmon’s click is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does. Hearing that subtle click is harder if there’s a lot of noise around you.”","“The main concern relating to this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales,” said Scott Veirs of Beamreach, who led the research. “That’s worrying because their prey, chinook salmon, is already quite scarce. Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does. Hearing that subtle click is harder if there’s a lot of noise around you.”"
"Some ships are quieter than others but the average noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, the same as 111 decibels through the air – about the sound of a loud rock concert. Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels – around the level of a vacuum cleaner.","The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 shipsas they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA. The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.","The researchers used underwater microphonesto measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State.

"Veirs said scientists already knew about the effect of underwater noise on large whales. But, the new research shows the danger to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises. “We think that ships make low-frequency noise, like the sound of lorries or trains,” he said. “Most noise is at that low frequency but there is more background noise in the high frequencies, too. This might be causing a big problem that we need to study more.”","Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the shipswas 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels through the air – about the sound of a loud rock concert. Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels – around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner.","Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the shipswas 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels through the air – about the sound of a loud rock concert.

"Lots of underwater noise can cause many problems. Whales may have to stay closer together to hear each other. And, if they cannot  nd food easily, they will need to use their extra blubber. This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are poisonous to whales if they get into their bodies.","Veirs said scientists already knew about the impact of underwater noise on large whales. But, thenew research shows the threat to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises. “Ships have been thought of as low-frequency sources of noise, like the rumbling of lorries or trains,” he said. “Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies. This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more","Veirs said scientists have already identi ed the impact of underwater noise upon baleen whales– a class of fauna containing the largest animals on Earth.

This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more.”"
"Veirs said ships that pass near whales need tobe quieter. “It should be easy to reduce noise pollution,” he said. “Military ships are much quieter and there could be simple ways of using that technology on normal ships. Another way to reduce noise is to slow down. Reducing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.”","There are several further consequences of a noisy underwater environment. Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other. And, if they fail to  nd prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of extra blubber. Thisis a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if they are released fully into their systems.","There are several knock-on consequences ofa noisy marine environment. Whales may haveto group together more closely in order to hear each other. And, should they fail to  nd prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of excess blubber. This is problematic as this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if released fully into their systems."
"Some whale species are safer now because there is less whaling but other types of whale are still in danger for many different reasons. The US has recently protected nearly 40,000 square miles of the Atlantic to save a species of whale with just 500 individuals left.","Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near them. “It should be easy to reduce noise pollution,” he said. “Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be simple ways of transferring that technology to commercial ships. Another way to reduce noise is to slow down. Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half.”","Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and alsoto quieten the ships that pass near the cetaceans. “It should be easy to reduce noise pollution,” he said. “Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be straightforward ways of transferring that technology to the commercial  eet.

"In Europe, killer whales have dangerouslyhigh levels of illegal chemicals in their blubber. Scientists are still trying to  nd out if pollutants caused the deaths of  ve whales that were found on beaches on the east coast of Britain in January 2016. And, around the coast of Australia, whales are in danger from oil and gas drilling, as well as Japan’s recent decision to start whaling again in the seas of Antarctica.","While some whale species, such as blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, are safer now because whaling has declined, others are still under threat from a range of factors.
