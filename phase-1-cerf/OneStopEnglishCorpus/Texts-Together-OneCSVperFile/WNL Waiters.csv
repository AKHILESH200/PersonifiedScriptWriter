Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal in the summer of 2015. This is when lots of restaurants were taking money from tips for administration fees. But you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains.,"Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. This is when dozens of restaurants were exposed for taking money from tips for administration fees. However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. Some restaurants take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee. It doesn’t matter how much you make in tips. This means that, if a table has a £100 bill and doesn’t tip, the waiter has to pay £4 of their own money. This leads to bad service. If a table doesn’t tip, the waiter feels as if the company is stealing their money and resentsthe customers.","Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. This iswhen it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees. However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. I’ve heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc (a payment arrangement used to distribute tips). Some restaurants will take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee. So, if you sell £1,000 worth of food, the company will take £40. This is regardless of how much you make in tips. This means that if a table has a £100 bill and doesn’t tip, the waiter has to pay £4 of their own money. This leads to a money-grabbing culture and, ironically, to bad service. If a table doesn’t tip, the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers."

"In restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips by card, the staff never see how much the tip is – so we don’t know if what we get is fair or not.

"It is very unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team doesn’t work hard enough. It’s really unfair that money from our tips is taken for breakages by customers.
