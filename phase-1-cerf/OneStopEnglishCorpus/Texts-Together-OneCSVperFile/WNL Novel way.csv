"The idea of helping people to leave is sensitive at a time when many Italians – many of them clever young graduates – are leaving their country every year. But Piscedda believes that the people heis sending away might return “and give me back 100 times what we gave them”. More importantly, he wants the scheme to help the people most in need.","The idea of encouraging people to leave is sensitive at a time when huge numbers of Italians – many of them bright young graduates – are leaving their country every year.

"In Elmas, the scheme has got mixed reactions. “There is little work here,” said Alessandro Macis. “The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile.
