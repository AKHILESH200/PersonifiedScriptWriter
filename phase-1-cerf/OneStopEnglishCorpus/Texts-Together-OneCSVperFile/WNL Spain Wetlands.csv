"The view from the visitors centre in the Donana National Park in southern Spain is a bird- watchers dream: 200,000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birds of western Europe. Many of Britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from Africa. Donana is also home to some of Europes rarest birds, including the Spanish imperial eagle.","The view from the visitors centre at the southern edge of Donana National Park in southern Spain is an ornithologists dream: 200,000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birdlife of western Europe.

This is an ornithologists dream: 200,000 hectares of salt marsh of unrivalled importance to the birdlife of western Europe. Dozens of Britains most loved migratory birds, including house martins, swallows, cuckoos and warblers, rest here on their annual migrations from Africa. Donana, a UN World Heritage Site, is also home to some of Europes rarest birds, including the Spanish imperial eagle, while its mammalian inhabitants include the highly endangeredIberian lynx."
"It is a beautiful landscape but it is under threat. In 1998, almost two billion gallons of toxic water, full of acid and waste metals, poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away. They collected more than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.","It is a glorious, vibrant landscape but it exists on a knife-edge. In 1998, almost two billion gallons of acidic water, mixed with waste metals, poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away. A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river into the park. More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.","It is a glorious, vibrant landscape. Yet it exists on a knife-edge, a point illustrated dramatically in 1998 when almost two billion gallons of contaminated, highly acidic water, mixed with waste metals, poured into the park from a dam that had burst its bank at Los Frailes mine 45km to the north. A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river and over its banks, leaving a thick metallic crust over a vast stretch of parkland. More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected in the aftermath and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed."
"It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost ¬90 million. Spain realized that Donana is the nations most important natural site, so the country decided to spend an extra ¬360 million on restoring the landscape to its original wetland state.","It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost ¬90m. Suddenly aware of Donanas status as the nations most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further ¬360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape. In the 1950s and 60s, some parts of this landscape had been drained to create rice and cotton  elds. Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state.","It was Spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost ¬90m.

"It has been an expensive process. And Donana is still under threat from the pressures of modern life. There are plans to build an oil pipeline through Donana and there is also an idea to build new hotels and golf courses, which would usea lot of local water. Sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross the park.","It has been a costly but positive process. But Donana is still in trouble thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life. There are plans tobuild an oil pipeline through Donana and other developers want to build new hotels and golf courses, which would need enormous water supplies.

Yet the fate of Donana still hangs in the balance thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life. Plans have been outlined to build an oil pipeline through Donana, while other developers have announced proposals to expand local tourist resorts whose new hotels and golf courses would demand water supplies that would further erode the local table. Silt washed from nearby farms is also choking the channels that criss-cross Donana."
"But, the biggest shock has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donanain 1998. This is Europes most important bird sanctuary, says Laurence Rose of the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). Donana already faces a lot of threats but now they want to bring back the cause of the disaster 16 years ago. It is extremely worrying.","However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andalucian government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Donana in 1998. This is Europes most precious bird sanctuary, for indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of north-west Europe, says Laurence Rose of the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). Donana already faces a large number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago.

"If you look at the state of the local economy, you quickly see why the government has made this decision. The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a very bad effect on the region. Unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%. If they reopen the mine, it would create more than 1,000 jobs.","The state of the local economy provides an explanation for the governments decision. The crash of Spains banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%. Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 jobs.","Having spent so much restoring Donana to itspast glories, it might seem strange that the local government should choose to announce that it wants mining companies to tender bids to rework Los Frailes. However, a brief examination of the state of the local economy provides an explanation. The crash of Spains banks in 2008 hit the region catastrophically and unemployment in some parts of Andalucia is now more than 30%. Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 precious jobs."
"There are riches here, riches that the local inhabitants badly need, said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero. We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area. This is a mining area. People have mined metals here since Roman times.","There are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said energy spokesman Vicente Fernandez Guerrero. We think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area.

"Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques, which do not create poisonous wet waste. They will use the best technology in the world here, Fernandez said. They will not use liquid. We will not allow that.","Fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste. Also, the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes when the disaster happened cannot run it again. The best technology in the world will be used here, Fernandez insisted. Liquid will not be used. We are going to insist on that.","More to the point, added Fernandez, the mine licence would stipulate that only modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste, would be allowed. (It has also stipulated that the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes cannot bid for the contract. Sixteen years afterthe accident, the two sides remained locked over compensation claims.) The best technology in the world will be used here, Fernandez insisted. Liquid will not be used. We are going to insist on that. Our tender makes that clear."
"Some people agree with the idea, but a lot of people disagree with it. Carlos Davila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Donana, was also alarmed at the idea. This is a very, very bad idea, he said. They say the new mine will be safe, but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened. We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain.","The plan has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition.

"Almost every visitor at a local restaurant hada camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars. Lots of tourists come to Don_ana because of the birdlife.

"The trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago. A repeatof the disaster today would have a much, much more damaging impact, said Rose. Davila agrees. After the disaster, Spain realized thatit had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added. Now, it seems we have forgotten that lesson.
