"How long can you hold your breath? I’m trying it right now. The  rst 30 seconds are easy. I want to give up at 45 seconds but I continue and it gets easier for a while. But, as I go past one minute, my heart is pounding. I breathe out a tiny bit and this helps. One minute and 12 seconds. I’m quite impressed with myself.","How long can you hold your breath?

But, as the second hand ticks past a minute, my heart is pounding. I let out a tiny breath and this helps. Eventually, I give up, releasing the air in my lungs and taking a huge breath.

"In some sports, it is very important to be able to hold your breath, particularly in freediving. In 2006, I met Sam Amps, who was captain of the UK freedive team. At a swimming pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple ways to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater. By the end of the session, I could hold my breath for 90 seconds, long enough to let me swim across the pool. Sam swam across the pool three times easily. She could hold her breath for  ve minutes, while swimming. Five minutes!","The ability to hold your breath is extremely important in some sports, particularly freediving.In 2006, I was  lming a programme about the anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a BBC series.

"I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.","I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.

"Our heart rate doesn’t slow down when we hold our breath. At least, it doesn’t if you’re doing it on land. When you’re under cold water, the heart rate slows down in most people. This change in our bodies is useful in diving – but it is even more useful fornot drowning.","Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence that, at some point during our evolution, we lived in water. Some even say that humans have an ability to lower their heart rate in order to breath-hold for even longer. Other facts – our hairlessness, the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even that we walk on two legs – have been linked to an aquatic phase of our evolutionary development. But, unfortunately, the “aquatic ape hypothesis” is not true.","Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence of a watery episodein human evolution. It’s even been said that humans have an ability to lower heart rate and metabolic rate in order to breath-hold for even longer. Other anatomical and physiological bitsand bobs – our hairlessness, the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even our tendency to walk on two legs – have been linked to an aquatic phase of evolutionary development. Unfortunately, the cobbled-together “aquatic ape hypothesis” fails to hold water. It’s a romantic notion that may appeal to us but, with the cold light of day falling on the scienti c evidence, it’s revealed to be nothing more than a fiction."
"Holding our breath is becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine. Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation exactly at the tumour. It’s usually done in short periods, between breaths. But, if the patient can hold their breath for several minutes, it means that doctors can give the complete radiation dose, in the right place, all at the same time. The problem, of course, is that most people cannot hold their breath for several minutes. But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have shown that, if patients are given air with extra oxygen before holding their breath, they can hold it for  ve-and-a-half minutes.","Looking at voluntary breath-holding, we are, in fact, not the only non-aquatic mammals that are able to hold their breath. (But it’s a dif cult thing to investigate in other mammals because, unlike humans, it’s dif cult to get them to hold their breath.) And evidence shows that our heart rate doesn’t drop during breath-holding. At least, it doesn’t if you’re breath-holding on land. When you’re in cold water, it’s different: this leads to a slower heart rate in most people. But, once again, this isn’t evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry.This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes called the “mammalian diving re ex”. But physiological responses that are useful in diving are also – and, perhaps, even more importantly – useful fornot drowning.","Looking at voluntary breath-holding, it turns out that we’re certainly not unique among non-aquatic mammals in being able to hold our breath. (Having said that, it’s a dif cult thing to investigate in other mammals as, unlike humans, they tend not to comply when you ask them to breath-hold.) And experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesn’t drop during breath-holding. At least, it doesn’t if you’re breath-holding on land. When you’re submerged in cold water it’s a different story: cooling the face does lead to a slower heart rate in most people. But, once again, this isn’t evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry, as it turns out to be a very general characteristic of air-breathing vertebrates. This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the “mammalian diving re ex”. But physiological responses that could be useful in diving are also – and, perhaps, even more importantly – useful for not drowning."
"Surprisingly, to achieve this you have to fool the diaphragm. When you breathe in, you’re pulling the muscle of your diaphragm  at so that the volume of your chest increases – this pulls the air into your lungs. When you hold your breath, you keep your diaphragm like that. If you breathe extra oxygen before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, you may be able to stop the diaphragm from becoming tired too quickly. So, it’s your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is in charge when you are holding your breath. But, in the end, even if you’ve fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm become too strong and you have to give up – and take a breath.","While our ability to breath-hold may not be special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, it’s now becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine. Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour. This may require several minutes of radiation and, so, it’s usually done in short periods, between breaths. But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectlystill for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be given, in the right place, in one go. The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, cannot hold their breath for much longer than a minute. But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have shown that, if patients are given oxygen-rich air before holding their breath, they can hold it for  ve-and-a-half minutes.","While our ability to breath-hold may not be allthat special, when we compare ourselves withother animals, it’s now proving very useful in one particular area of medicine.

The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, struggle to hold their breath for much longer than a minute.

Eventually, even if you’ve fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give up – and take a breath.","Surprisingly, the trick seems to lie not in foolingthe body’s usual sensors for low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels in the blood but in fooling the diaphragm. When you breathe in, you’re contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it  at so that the volume of your chest increases – and air is drawn into your lungs. When you hold your breath, you keep your diaphragm in this contracted state. Arti cially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm. And – not so useful if you’re trying to keep your chest perfectly still – breathing out a little air lets the diaphragm relax a little, and helps you to prolong a breath-hold, exactly as I found when attempting my breath-hold. And, so, it’s your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breakpoint of your breath-hold. Eventually, even if you’ve fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give in – and take a breath."
