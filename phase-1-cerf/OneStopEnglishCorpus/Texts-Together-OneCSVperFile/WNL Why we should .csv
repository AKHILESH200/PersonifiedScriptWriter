As part of his series, ‘If Our Bodies Could Talk’, Hamblin, a relatively sane- looking man, took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body. He reduced the number of showers he had and eliminated shampoo and soap when he did."
"He discovered what thousands of others have also discovered: the more we try to clean ourselves with soaps and body washes, the more our skin works to get back its balance.This means we have to begin the whole process again. Showering removes oil and bacteria from the skin. Many would say “That is the reason I shower!” But, it seems that this sometimes works too well, especially when you add hot water and soap products.","He discovered what thousands of others have: the more we try to clean ourselves with soaps and body washes, the harder our skin worksto restore its balance and this encourages usto begin the whole process again.

Showering strips the skin of its own oil and bacteria – which, many would argue, is thewhole point of showering – but, apparently, this sometimes works a little too well, especially when you add hot water and cleansing products tothe mix."
"Our skin has millions of good bacteria. Showering destroys these bacteria. And when the bacteria return, they produce an odour – yes, showering too often may make you smell more. But, when you stop showering and using soap, your skin goes through a (probably gross) period of change. After this, the skin normally gets its balance back, it produces less oil and healthy bacteria  ourish.","You know that feeling after a shower when you feel like your skin is tight? That’s because much of your skin’s natural moisture has been washed down the drain. Also, our skin, like our gut,has millions of bene cial bacteria. Showering destroys these bacterial colonies; they’re completely destroyed by all our frequent rubbing and scrubbing. And, when the bacteria washed off by soap return, they usually favour microbes which produce an odour – yes, showeringtoo often may actually make you smell more. However, when you stop showering and using soap, your skin goes through an initial (probably gross) adjustment period and, then, after that, the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria  ourish.","You know that feeling after a shower when you feel like you’re stuck in a skin suit two sizestoo small? That’s because much of your skin’s natural moisture has been washed down the drain. Additionally, our skin, much like our gut, plays host to millions of bene cial bacteria. Showering destroys these happy bacterial colonies; they’re completely wiped out by all of our frequent rubbing and scrubbing. And, when the bacteria washed off by soap repopulate, they tend to favour microbes which produce an odour – yes, too-frequent showering may actually make you smell more. When you stop showering and using soap, however, your skin goes through an initial (likely gross) adjustment period, after which the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria  ourish."
"Hamblin realized that the human body, working on its own, is lovely. We will smell and lookbetter – skin experts say that using less soap can improve skin problems. But, that’s not the only advantage – reducing the number of showerswe have (and the number of cleansing products we use) can help the environment. The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water. That’s 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we  ll with soap and wash down the drain each and every day – sometimes morethan once.","By doing the challenge, Hamblin realized what other no-soap/no-shower fans have known for years: that the human body, working on its own, is actually quite lovely. And, it’s not just scent and aesthetics – although skin experts suggest that using less soap can improve skin conditions like eczema. Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has implications for our environment. The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water. That’s 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we’re  lling with soap and washing downthe drain each day – sometimes more than once.","After everything was said and done, Hamblin realized what other no-soap/no-shower devotees have known for years: that the human body, functioning on its own, is actually quite lovely.It’s not just scent or aesthetics, either – although dermatologists suggest that slowing downon soap use can improve acne and eczema. Reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has very real implications for our environment. The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water. That’s 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we’re infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day – sometimes more than once."
"The importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore – for example, there is another summer of drought in California.It’s becoming clear that clean water is one ofthe most valuable things in the world and we soon won’t have enough. There is also the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles. So, there are many very good reasons to shower less.","The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as California enters another summer of drought. It’s becoming clear that clean water is one of the most valuable things in the world and we soon won’t have enough. Add the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles and you have a number of very good reasons to let your body be a bitmore natural.","The vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as California enters another summer of drought. It’s becoming clear that clean water is one of the world’s most valuable commodities and one that will soon be in short supply. Add in the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles and you’ve got yourself a handful of very compelling reasons to let your body go au naturel."
"Perhaps you remember the last time you were close to people who already don’t shower enough but you can relax. Many people who shower less still use deodorant and hand-washing with soap is still a vital way to reduce the spread ofmany diseases.","If the idea of showering less and using lesssoap is giving you the heebie-jeebies as you remember the last time you were close to people who already don’t shower enough, relax. Many people who have decided to shower less still use deodorant if they  nd it necessary (everyone’s natural scent varies in intensity and it can be affected by a number of things including diet, hydration and exercise). And, hand-washingwith soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.","If this whole thing is giving you the heebie-jeebies as you recall the last time you were cheek byjowl with those who evidently already skimp on the showers – and have clearly not reached the scent-free stage yet – relax. Many cleansing- reduction enthusiasts still use deodorant if they  nd it necessary (everyone’s natural scent varies in intensity and can be affected by a host of factors including diet, hydration and exercise) and hand-washing with soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread ofinfectious diseases."
"You don’t need to give up showering completely, as James Hamblin did, but if you shower a lot, we have some simple advice: reduce. Shower less, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish.","You don’t need to give up completely, as Hamblin did, but you don’t need to shower three timesa day either. There is something in the middle. Our familiar, simple advice is: reduce. Skip a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish a little.","You don’t need to go cold turkey, as Hamblin did, but in between thrice-daily disinfecting sessions and giving up showers altogether there lies room for our familiar, simple advice. Reduce. Skip a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish a little, would you?"
