"In Iceland, you can be called Aagot, Arney or
Ásfríður; Baldey, Bebba or Brá. Dögg, Dimmblá,
Etna and Eybjört are fine and so are Frigg,
Glódís, Hörn and Ingunn. Jórlaug is OK and so
are Obba, Sigurfljóð, Úranía and Vagna. But,
if you are a girl in Iceland, you cannot be
called Harriet.","In Iceland, you can be called Aagot, Arney or

"“The situation is silly,” said Tristan Cardew, a
British cook who moved to Iceland in 2000. With
his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing
against a decision by the National Registry in
the capital Reykjavik – the registry decided not
to renew the Cardew’s ten-year-old daughter
Harriet’s passport because it does not recognize
her first name.","“The whole situation,” said Tristan Cardew, “is
really rather silly.” With his Icelandic wife, Kristin,

first name.","“The whole situation,” said Tristan Cardew, with

"The registry does not recognize the name of
Harriet’s 12-year-old brother Duncan either, so,
until now, the two children have travelled on
passports with the names Stúlka and Drengur
Cardew, which mean Girl and Boy Cardew. But,
this time, the registry has decided to apply the
law. “And the law says no official document will
be given to people who do not have an approved
Icelandic name.”","Since the registry does not recognize the name

authorities have decided to apply the letter of the
law,” Cardew, a British-born cook who moved to
Iceland in 2000, said. “And that says no official

"The situation meant the family were going to miss
their holiday in France but they have applied
to the British embassy for an emergency UK
passport, which should now allow them to leave.","The situation meant the family, from Kópavogur,

"Names are important in Iceland, a country of
only 320,000 people. The law says that – unless
both parents are foreign – the names of children
born in Iceland must be submitted to the National
Registry within six months of birth. If a name
is not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and
1,712 male names, the parents must get approval
from the Icelandic Naming Committee.","Names are important in Iceland, a country of
only 320,000 people, whose phone book lists
subscribers by their first name for the very
sensible reason that most Icelandic surnames
simply record the fact that you are your father’s

children, for example, might be Ólafur Jónsson
and Sigríður Jónsdóttir.","Names matter in Iceland, a country of barely

"About 5,000 children are born in Iceland each
year and the committee receives about 100
applications. It rejects about half of these names
because it wants to preserve the Icelandic
language. There is a law that says names must
be able to have Icelandic grammatical endings
and should be written using the ordinary rules of
Icelandic spelling.","The law says that the names of children born in

"What this means is that names with letters
that do not officially exist in Iceland’s 32-letter
alphabet, such as “c”, are not permitted. Also,
names that cannot be used with the case endings
used in Icelandic are also rejected. “That was the
problem with Harriet,” said Cardew.","For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland
each year, the committee reportedly receives
about 100 applications and rejects about half
under a 1996 law aimed mainly at preserving the
Icelandic language. Among its requirements are
that given names must be “capable of having
Icelandic grammatical endings”, may not “conflict
with the linguistic structure of Iceland” and should
be “written in accordance with the ordinary rules
of Icelandic spelling”.","For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland

"The country’s naming laws have been criticized
in recent years: in 2013, Blær – “Light Breeze”
– Bjarkardóttir Rúnarsdottir won the right to be
officially called her name, not “Girl”. The former
mayor of Reykjavik, Jón Gnarr, has also called
Iceland’s naming law “unfair, stupid and
against creativity”.","What this means in practice is that names
containing letters that do not officially exist in
Iceland’s 32-letter alphabet, such as “c”, are out.
Similarly, names unable to accommodate the
