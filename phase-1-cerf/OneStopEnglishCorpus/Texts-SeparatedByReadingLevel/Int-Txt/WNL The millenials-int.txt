It is no secret that millennials use technology a lot. More than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed, almost two thirds admit they text while driving, one in  ve has posted a video of themselves online and three quarters have created a pro le on a social networking site. But there is a small percentage of millennials who dont use social media at all. Here are four of them.
Celan Beausoleil, 31, Oakland, California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an on and off relationship with Facebook. She last deactivated her account in December 2015 because she found the amount of personal information shared by others too heavy to deal with in addition to her work demands.
In my job, I spend a lot of time listening to peoples lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodys lives, including people that I dont really have a relationship with, she said. Im involved a lot with people in my work life and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also.
But Beausoleil loves the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way. One thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and end up on someones Facebook page from the other side of the world, she said. I used to do that all the time.
Jason Mathias, 26, Baltimore, Maryland One day, I realized: Im spending so much time doing this. These little seconds add up. I wonder what it would be like if I didnt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else. What if I was doing other things with these seconds? What would they become? Would I enjoy it?
Mathias had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in November 2012. But he quickly forgot that Facebook existed after his impromptu decision to end his social media presence. He can still appreciate the bene ts that come with having social media accounts, for example how easy it is to organize large events online. He now relies on friends for party invites.
But now he loves his extra free time. He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books. And with no friends accounts to follow online, he has to pick up the phone and call them, something hes come to enjoy.
Lauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a pretty private person. So social media is not that appealing to her. My privacy is important to me and I have concerns about giving out my data, she said. She recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago when she realized that she didnt like everyone knowing what I was doing. But she can see the positive sides of social media. When a friend of hers that shed lost track of moved to Naples for a month, Raskauskas didnt even realize she was there until after shed left, which was a bummer.
But in the end, her privacy concerns outweighed any bene ts social media could give her and she saw a de nite upside when she went through a recent break-up. The last time a relationship of hers ended and she was online, it was not pleasant. One time, I broke up with somebody while I was on Facebook and I was like Oh my gosh, should I change my pro le photo? Should I change my status? And, this time, I dont have to worry about any of that, she said.
Hariharan Rajagopalan, 18, Boston, Massachusetts Rajagopalan, a student at Boston College, doesnt see any problem with not using social media. He claims that he hasnt seen any effect at this point. Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook, they make sure to send him a text message, too, he said.
The only time Rajagopalan used social media was when it was unavoidable: it was the only way to reach his new roommate at college. Before starting his  rst year at college, he signed up for his  rst, and only, social media account. He joined Facebook in order to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year.
He still has the account but he admits: I dont use it. I dont check it or anything like that. He has avoided other social media accounts but, as a sports fan, he acknowledged that Twitter is where most of the news  rst appears. But he refused to get an account because, he says, I dont really need one to read tweets.
